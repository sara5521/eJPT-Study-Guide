## üß™ Real Lab Examples

### Example 1: Network Host Discovery
```bash
# Step 1: Check local IP configuration
ipconfig
# Output: IPv4 Address: 10.0.17.63, Subnet Mask: 255.255.240.0

# Step 2: Launch Zenmap and set target
Target: 10.0.17.0/20
Command: nmap -T4 -A -v 10.0.17.0/20

# Step 3: Execute scan
# Output: Starting Nmap 7.91 at 2020-12-26 13:06
# NSE: Loaded 153 scripts for scanning
# Initiating NSE at 13:06
# Completed NSE at 13:06, 0.08s elapsed
# Initiating ARP Ping Scan at 13:06
# Scanning 4095 hosts [1 port/host]
# Completed ARP Ping Scan at 13:06, 14.88s elapsed
```

### Example 2: Service Discovery and Analysis
```bash
# Discovered hosts from lab:
# ip-10-0-16-1.ap-southeast-1.compute.internal (10.0.16.1)
# ip-10-0-17-63.ap-southeast-1.compute.internal (10.0.17.63)  
# ip-10-0-22-246.ap-southeast-1.compute.internal (10.0.22.246)
# ip-10-0-30-248.ap-southeast-1.compute.internal (10.0.30.248)

# Services tab analysis:
# 10.0.30.248:80 - HTTP (HttpFileServer httpd 2.3)
# Multiple hosts with Microsoft Windows RPC on ports 135, 49154, 49155

# Results interpretation:
# - 4 hosts discovered in network range
# - Port 80 (HTTP) found on 10.0.30.248 running HFS 2.3
# - Multiple Windows machines identified via RPC services
```

### Example 3: Network Topology Visualization
```bash
# Navigate to Topology tab in Zenmap
# Enable Fisheye view for network diagram

# Topology analysis from lab:
# Yellow node: 10.0.17.63 (attacker machine/localhost)
# Green nodes: Accessible hosts (10.0.16.1, 10.0.22.246)
# Red node: 10.0.30.248 (alive but limited access)

# Color meanings:
# Green = Machine is accessible/responding
# Red = Machine is alive but not responding/not directly accessible
# Yellow = Local machine (scan origin point)
```

## üéØ eJPT Exam Focus

### Essential Skills for eJPT:
- **Network Discovery (25%)** - Finding live hosts in target networks
- **Service Enumeration (30%)** - Identifying running services and versions
- **Topology Mapping (20%)** - Understanding network layout and relationships
- **Result Analysis (25%)** - Interpreting scan outputs for vulnerability assessment

### Critical Commands to Master:
```bash
# Host discovery scan
nmap -T4 -A -v 10.0.17.0/20  # Complete network reconnaissance

# Quick service scan
nmap -T4 -F target_ip  # Fast common port scan

# Ping sweep
nmap -sn network_range  # Host discovery without port scan
```

### eJPT Exam Scenarios:
1. **Network Reconnaissance:** Given a network range, identify all live hosts
   - Required skills: Network scanning, CIDR notation understanding
   - Expected commands: `nmap -T4 -A -v network/mask`
   - Success criteria: Complete host inventory with services

2. **Service Identification:** Determine running services on discovered hosts
   - Required skills: Port scanning, service fingerprinting
   - Expected commands: Service enumeration scans
   - Success criteria: Accurate service versions and potential vulnerabilities

### Exam Tips and Tricks:
- **Time Management:** Use Intense scan profile for comprehensive results
- **Documentation:** Always save scan results for report generation
- **Visual Analysis:** Use topology view to understand network relationships
- **Service Focus:** Pay attention to HTTP services and version numbers

### Common eJPT Questions:
- How many hosts are alive in the given network range?
- What services are running on specific ports?
- Which host appears to be the most vulnerable based on service versions?

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Issues & Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: Zenmap Won't Start on Windows
**Problem:** Zenmap fails to launch or shows Python errors
**Cause:** Missing Python dependencies or PATH issues
**Solution:**
```bash
# Reinstall with all components
# Download latest Nmap package from nmap.org
# Ensure "Register Path" option is checked during installation

# Verify installation
nmap --version
zenmap --version
```

### Issue 2: Permission Denied for SYN Scans
**Problem:** Cannot perform SYN scans (-sS) from GUI
**Solution:**
```bash
# Run Zenmap as administrator (Windows)
# Right-click ‚Üí Run as administrator

# Linux - use sudo
sudo zenmap
```

### Issue 3: Slow Scan Performance
**Problem:** Scans taking too long to complete
**Optimization:**
```bash
# Use faster timing template
nmap -T4 target  # Aggressive timing

# Limit port range
nmap -F target   # Fast scan (100 most common ports)

# Reduce host timeout
nmap --host-timeout 30s target
```

### Issue 4: Network Range Discovery Issues
**Problem:** Not finding expected number of hosts
**Prevention:**
```bash
# Verify network range calculation
# Use online CIDR calculators
# Check local network configuration with ipconfig/ifconfig

# Test with ping sweep first
nmap -sn network_range
```

## üîó Integration with Other Tools

### Primary Integration: Nmap ‚Üí Zenmap ‚Üí Report Tools
```bash
# Workflow: Command line to GUI analysis
nmap -oX scan_results.xml target
# Import XML into Zenmap for visual analysis
# Export results to various formats

# Integration steps:
# 1. Nmap generates XML output
# 2. Zenmap imports and visualizes
# 3. Results exported for reporting
```

### Secondary Integration: Zenmap ‚Üí Vulnerability Scanners
```bash
# Export discovered hosts for further scanning
# File ‚Üí Export ‚Üí Host List (Plain text)
# Use host list with tools like Nikto, SQLmap

# Zenmap discovery ‚Üí Extract HTTP services ‚Üí Nikto scan
```

### Advanced Workflows:
```bash
# Scheduled scanning with result comparison
# Use Zenmap's diff functionality to track changes
# Tools ‚Üí Compare Results
# Select two different scan dates for comparison
```
