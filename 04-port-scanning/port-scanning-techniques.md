# üîß Port Scanning Techniques - Complete Penetration Testing Guide

Advanced port scanning methodologies for network discovery, service identification, and firewall evasion in penetration testing scenarios.
**Location:** `04-port-scanning/port-scanning-techniques.md`

## üéØ What is Port Scanning?

Port scanning is a fundamental reconnaissance technique used to discover open ports and running services on target systems. This process involves sending specially crafted packets to specific ports to determine their state (open, closed, or filtered) and identify the services running behind them.

Port scanning serves multiple purposes in penetration testing:
- **Service Discovery:** Identify running services and their versions
- **Attack Surface Mapping:** Determine potential entry points into systems
- **Firewall Detection:** Discover filtering rules and security mechanisms
- **Network Topology Understanding:** Map network infrastructure and connectivity

## üì¶ Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites:
- Kali Linux or similar penetration testing distribution
- Basic understanding of TCP/IP protocols
- Network connectivity to target systems
- Proper authorization for testing

### Essential Tools:
```bash
# Verify Nmap installation
nmap --version
# Expected output: Nmap version 7.94SVN

# Install additional tools if needed
apt update && apt install nmap masscan rustscan

# Verify network connectivity
ping -c 3 target_ip
```

### Initial Configuration:
```bash
# Create results directory
mkdir -p ~/port-scans/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)
cd ~/port-scans/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)

# Set up environment variables
export TARGET="demo.ine.local"
export TARGET_IP="10.0.18.217"
```

## üîß Basic Usage and Syntax

### Basic Workflow:
1. **Host Discovery:** Verify if target is alive
2. **Port Discovery:** Identify open ports
3. **Service Detection:** Determine running services
4. **Version Detection:** Gather service version information

### Command Structure:
```bash
# Basic Nmap syntax
nmap [scan_type] [options] target

# Common scanning progression
ping -c 5 target                    # Basic connectivity test
nmap target                         # Default scan
nmap -Pn target                     # Skip host discovery
nmap -Pn -sV -p port target        # Service version detection

   - Success criteria: Map complete attack surface

### Exam Tips and Tricks:
- **Tip 1: Always use -Pn option** - Many exam targets don't respond to ping
- **Tip 2: Start with default scan, then get specific** - Efficient time management
- **Tip 3: Document filtered ports** - They often indicate firewall presence
- **Tip 4: Use -sV for known open ports** - Version info crucial for exploitation

### Common eJPT Questions:
- How to scan hosts that don't respond to ping?
- What's the difference between filtered and closed ports?
- How to identify service versions on open ports?
- Which Nmap option skips host discovery?

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Issues & Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: Target Appears Down But Is Actually Up
**Problem:** Nmap shows "Host seems down" even when target is accessible
**Cause:** ICMP filtering or host-based firewall blocking ping probes
**Solution:**
```bash
# Force scan without ping
nmap -Pn target
# Alternative: Use different ping methods
nmap -PS80,443 target
nmap -PA80 target
```

### Issue 2: All Ports Show as Filtered
**Problem:** Every scanned port returns "filtered" state
**Cause:** Firewall dropping packets without ICMP responses
**Solution:**
```bash
# Try different scan types
nmap -sA target          # ACK scan for firewall detection
nmap -sF target          # FIN scan
nmap -sX target          # XMAS scan
nmap --scanflags URG,ACK,PSH,RST,SYN,FIN target
```

### Issue 3: Slow Scanning Performance
**Problem:** Scans taking excessively long to complete
**Solution:**
```bash
# Increase scan speed (be careful with timing)
nmap --min-rate 1000 target
nmap -T4 target
# Focus on specific ports instead of full range
nmap --top-ports 1000 target
```

### Issue 4: Incomplete Service Detection
**Problem:** Service versions not detected properly
**Solution:**
```bash
# Increase service detection intensity
nmap -sV --version-intensity 9 target
# Combine with scripts for more info
nmap -sV -sC target
# Manual service testing
nc -nv target port
```

## üîó Integration with Other Tools

### Primary Integration: Nmap ‚Üí Service Enumeration ‚Üí Exploitation
```bash
# Complete workflow showing tool integration
nmap -Pn -sV -oA initial_scan target

# Parse results for specific services
grep "open" initial_scan.nmap | grep "http"
# Follow up with HTTP-specific tools
nikto -h http://target
dirb http://target

# For SMB services discovered
grep "445/tcp" initial_scan.nmap
smbclient -L target
enum4linux target
```

### Secondary Integration: Nmap ‚Üí Vulnerability Assessment
```bash
# Nmap script engine for vulnerability detection
nmap --script vuln target
# Feed results into vulnerability scanners
nmap -oX scan.xml target
# Import into OpenVAS or Nessus for detailed assessment
```

### Advanced Workflows:
```bash
# Automated reconnaissance pipeline
nmap -Pn -sS -oA discovery target_network/24
# Extract live hosts
grep "Up" discovery.gnmap | cut -d" " -f2 > live_hosts.txt
# Detailed scan of live hosts
nmap -Pn -sV -sC -oA detailed -iL live_hosts.txt
# Service-specific enumeration
for host in $(cat live_hosts.txt); do
  nmap --script http-* -p 80,443,8080 $host
done
```

## üìù Documentation and Reporting

### Evidence Collection Requirements:
1. **Screenshots:** Command execution and results for each scan type
2. **Command Outputs:** Save all Nmap results in multiple formats (-oA)
3. **Log Files:** Preserve timing and performance metrics
4. **Network Diagrams:** Document discovered services and their relationships

### Key Findings
- **Firewall Detected:** Host does not respond to ICMP ping
- **Open Services:** HTTP (80), MSRPC (135), SMB (445), RDP (3389)
- **Filtered Ports:** HTTPS (443) - potential firewall rule
- **Service Versions:** HttpFileServer httpd 2.3 on port 80

### Port State Summary
- **Open Ports:** 7 (http, msrpc, netbios-ssn, microsoft-ds, ms-wbt-server, unknown x2)
- **Filtered Ports:** 993 (likely firewall-protected)
- **Closed Ports:** 0 (not explicitly closed)

### Security Implications
- Multiple Windows services exposed (SMB, RDP)
- Web service running potentially vulnerable HttpFileServer
- Firewall present but allows certain services through

### Recommendations
- Investigate HttpFileServer version 2.3 for known vulnerabilities
- Review firewall rules for port 443 filtering
- Consider restricting RDP access to specific networks
- Audit SMB share permissions and access controls
