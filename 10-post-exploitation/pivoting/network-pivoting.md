# üîß Network Pivoting - Internal Network Access

Advanced techniques for accessing internal networks through compromised systems acting as pivot points.

## üéØ What is Network Pivoting?
Network pivoting is a post-exploitation technique that uses a compromised system as a gateway to access additional networks that are not directly reachable from the attacker's position. This technique is essential for penetrating segmented networks, bypassing firewall restrictions, and conducting lateral movement through complex infrastructure environments.

Key capabilities include:
- **Multi-homed System Access** - Leveraging systems connected to multiple networks
- **Internal Network Discovery** - Identifying systems on previously unknown subnets  
- **Firewall Bypass** - Circumventing network security controls through trusted systems
- **Lateral Movement** - Expanding access across network boundaries

## üì¶ Pivoting Prerequisites and Setup

### Network Architecture Requirements:
- **Pivot System:** Compromised host with multiple network interfaces
- **Target Networks:** Internal subnets accessible only through pivot
- **Routing Configuration:** Proper route table management in exploitation framework

### Initial Compromise Verification:
```bash
# Verify compromised system network interfaces
meterpreter > shell
ip addr show

# Expected multi-homed configuration:
# eth0: 192.63.4.3/24 (external network)  
# eth1: 192.180.108.2/24 (internal network)
```

### Framework Setup:
```bash
# Ensure active meterpreter session
sessions -l

# Verify session connectivity
sessions -i 1
meterpreter > sysinfo
```

## üîß Basic Pivoting Workflow

### Pivoting Process Steps:
1. **Network Discovery:** Identify available network interfaces on compromised system
2. **Route Addition:** Configure framework routing to use compromised system as gateway
3. **Target Identification:** Discover systems on internal networks through pivot
4. **Service Enumeration:** Scan discovered systems for vulnerable services
5. **Secondary Exploitation:** Attack internal systems through established pivot

### Core Pivoting Commands:
```bash
# Add routing through session
run autoroute -s network/mask

# Manual route addition
route add network netmask session_id

# Verify routing table  
route print

# Background session for pivot usage
background
```
