**Location:** `01-theory-foundations/networking-fundamentals.md`

## üéØ What is Networking for Penetration Testing?

Networking forms the backbone of all penetration testing activities. Understanding how networks function, communicate, and can be exploited is crucial for successful ethical hacking. This foundation covers the essential protocols, services, and concepts that every penetration tester must master.

Key areas include:
- Network models and architecture
- TCP/IP protocol suite
- Common ports and services
- Network addressing and routing
- Protocol analysis and exploitation

## üìö Network Models and Architecture

### OSI Model (7 Layers)
Understanding the OSI model helps identify where attacks occur and how to troubleshoot network issues.

| Layer | Name | Function | Protocols/Examples | eJPT Relevance |
|-------|------|----------|-------------------|----------------|
| 7 | Application | User interface | HTTP, FTP, SSH, DNS | Web attacks, service enumeration |
| 6 | Presentation | Data formatting | SSL/TLS, encryption | Certificate attacks, encryption flaws |
| 5 | Session | Session management | NetBIOS, SQL sessions | Session hijacking, persistence |
| 4 | Transport | End-to-end delivery | TCP, UDP | Port scanning, service discovery |
| 3 | Network | Routing | IP, ICMP, IPSec | Network discovery, routing attacks |
| 2 | Data Link | Frame delivery | Ethernet, ARP | ARP spoofing, MAC attacks |
| 1 | Physical | Hardware transmission | Cables, switches | Physical access, network tapping |

### TCP/IP Model (4 Layers)
The practical model used in real networks:

1. **Application Layer** (HTTP, FTP, SSH, DNS)
2. **Transport Layer** (TCP, UDP) 
3. **Internet Layer** (IP, ICMP)
4. **Network Access Layer** (Ethernet, ARP)

## üîå Essential Protocols for Penetration Testing

### Internet Protocol (IP)
```bash
# IPv4 Address Structure
192.168.1.100/24
# Network: 192.168.1.0
# Host: 100  
# Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0 (/24)

# IPv6 Address Structure  
2001:db8::1/64
# Network: 2001:db8::/64
# Host: ::1
```

### Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
**Characteristics:**
- Connection-oriented
- Reliable delivery
- Error checking
- Flow control

**TCP Three-Way Handshake:**
1. Client ‚Üí Server: SYN
2. Server ‚Üí Client: SYN-ACK  
3. Client ‚Üí Server: ACK

**TCP Flags Important for Scanning:**
| Flag | Purpose | Penetration Testing Use |
|------|---------|------------------------|
| SYN | Synchronize | Port scanning, connection establishment |
| ACK | Acknowledge | Firewall evasion, connection tracking |
| FIN | Finish | Stealth scanning, connection termination |
| RST | Reset | Port closed indication, connection reset |
| PSH | Push | Data transmission priority |
| URG | Urgent | Data priority signaling |

### User Datagram Protocol (UDP)
**Characteristics:**
- Connectionless
- Fast transmission
- No reliability guarantees
- Used for real-time applications

## üß™ Real Lab Examples

### Example 1: Network Discovery with Ping
```bash
# Test single host connectivity
ping -c 4 192.168.1.1
# Output: 4 packets transmitted, 4 received, 0% packet loss

# Ping sweep for network discovery
ping -c 1 192.168.1.1 && echo "Host is up"
# Output: Host is up

# Advanced ping with specific packet size
ping -c 3 -s 1000 192.168.1.1
# Output: Testing with larger packets to detect MTU issues
```

### Example 2: Protocol Analysis with Netstat
```bash
# View active connections
netstat -an | head -10
# Output: Shows active TCP and UDP connections with numerical addresses

# View listening services
netstat -tlnp
# Output: Shows listening TCP services with process information

# View routing table
netstat -rn  
# Output: Displays routing table with gateway information
```

### Example 3: ARP Table Investigation
```bash
# View ARP table
arp -a
# Output: Shows IP to MAC address mappings on local network

# ARP for specific host
arp 192.168.1.1
# Output: Shows MAC address for gateway

# Clear ARP cache (requires sudo)
sudo arp -d 192.168.1.100
# Output: Removes specific ARP entry
```

### Example 4: Network Interface Analysis
```bash
# View network interfaces
ip addr show
# Output: Shows all network interfaces with IP assignments

# View interface statistics
ip -s link show eth0
# Output: Shows packet statistics for specific interface

# View routing table with IP command
ip route show
# Output: Shows routing table with more detailed information than netstat
```

## üî¢ Subnetting and IP Addressing

### CIDR Notation and Subnet Masks
```bash
# Common subnet masks and their meanings
/24 = 255.255.255.0    # 254 hosts
/25 = 255.255.255.128  # 126 hosts  
/26 = 255.255.255.192  # 62 hosts
/27 = 255.255.255.224  # 30 hosts
/28 = 255.255.255.240  # 14 hosts
/29 = 255.255.255.248  # 6 hosts
/30 = 255.255.255.252  # 2 hosts (point-to-point links)
```

### Private IP Address Ranges
```bash
# Class A Private
10.0.0.0/8        # 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255

# Class B Private  
172.16.0.0/12     # 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255

# Class C Private
192.168.0.0/16    # 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255

# Loopback
127.0.0.0/8       # 127.0.0.0 - 127.255.255.255

# Link-Local
169.254.0.0/16    # 169.254.0.0 - 169.254.255.255
```

### Quick Subnetting Practice
```bash
# Example: Network 192.168.1.0/26
# Subnet mask: 255.255.255.192
# Network address: 192.168.1.0
# First usable: 192.168.1.1  
# Last usable: 192.168.1.62
# Broadcast: 192.168.1.63
# Next subnet: 192.168.1.64
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Networking Issues & Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: No Network Connectivity
**Problem:** Cannot reach target hosts or services
**Troubleshooting Steps:**
```bash
# Step 1: Check local interface
ip addr show

# Step 2: Test local connectivity  
ping -c 1 127.0.0.1

# Step 3: Test gateway connectivity
ping -c 1 $(ip route | grep default | awk '{print $3}')

# Step 4: Test DNS resolution
nslookup google.com
```

### Issue 2: Slow Network Performance
**Problem:** Network connections are slow or timing out
**Diagnosis:**
```bash
# Check for packet loss
ping -c 10 target_ip

# Check network interface errors
ip -s link show eth0

# Monitor network traffic
iftop -i eth0
```

### Issue 3: DNS Resolution Problems
**Problem:** Cannot resolve domain names
**Solution:**
```bash
# Test DNS servers
nslookup google.com 8.8.8.8

# Check DNS configuration
cat /etc/resolv.conf

# Test with different DNS
dig @1.1.1.1 example.com
```

## üîó Integration with Penetration Testing Tools

### Network Discovery Chain
```bash
# Phase 1: Network range identification
netdiscover -r 192.168.1.0/24

# Phase 2: Host discovery  
nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24

# Phase 3: Service discovery
nmap -sS -O 192.168.1.100

# Phase 4: Service enumeration
nmap -sC -sV -p 80,443 192.168.1.100
```

### Protocol Analysis Workflow
```bash
# Capture network traffic
tcpdump -i eth0 -w capture.pcap

# Analyze protocols in captured traffic
tcpdump -r capture.pcap -n | head -20

# Filter specific protocols
tcpdump -r capture.pcap 'tcp port 80'
```

## üìù Documentation and Reporting

### Network Documentation Requirements
When documenting network findings for eJPT reports:

1. **Network Topology:** Document discovered networks and their relationships
2. **Host Inventory:** List all discovered hosts with IP addresses and MAC addresses  
3. **Service Matrix:** Create a table showing which services run on which hosts
4. **Protocol Usage:** Document what protocols are in use on the network
