**Location:** `01-theory-foundations/pentesting-methodology/ejpt-methodology.md`

## üéØ What is the eJPT Methodology?

The eJPT (eLearnSecurity Junior Penetration Tester) methodology is a structured approach to penetration testing that emphasizes practical, hands-on skills in network and web application security assessment. Unlike theoretical frameworks, the eJPT methodology focuses on real-world scenarios where penetration testers must demonstrate technical competency in information gathering, vulnerability assessment, exploitation, and reporting within time-constrained environments.

This methodology is designed around the eJPT exam structure: Assessment Methodologies (17%), Host & Network Auditing (23%), Host & Network Penetration Testing (23%), and Web Application Penetration Testing (37%).

## üì¶ eJPT Methodology Overview

### Core Methodology Framework:
```bash
# eJPT Penetration Testing Phases
1. Information Gathering     (Passive + Active Reconnaissance)
2. Vulnerability Assessment  (Automated + Manual Testing)
3. Exploitation             (Network + Web Application)
4. Post-Exploitation        (Privilege Escalation + Persistence)
5. Reporting               (Documentation + Recommendations)
```

### Time Allocation Strategy (48-hour exam):
```bash
# Recommended time distribution
Information Gathering:    6-8 hours   (15-17%)
Vulnerability Assessment: 8-10 hours  (20-21%)
Exploitation:            20-24 hours  (42-50%)
Post-Exploitation:       8-10 hours   (17-21%)
Reporting:               4-6 hours    (8-12%)
```

## üîß Phase 1: Information Gathering (eJPT Focus: 23% - Host & Network Auditing)

### Passive Reconnaissance:
```bash
# Domain and subdomain enumeration
whois target-domain.com
dig target-domain.com
nslookup target-domain.com

# Search engine reconnaissance
# Google dorking for exposed information
# Social media intelligence gathering
# Public database searches
```

### Active Reconnaissance:
```bash
# Network discovery
nmap -sn target_network/24              # Ping sweep
netdiscover -r target_network/24        # ARP discovery

# Port scanning
nmap -sS --top-ports 1000 target_ip    # Quick TCP scan
nmap -sS -p 1-65535 target_ip          # Full TCP scan
nmap -sU --top-ports 100 target_ip     # UDP scan

# Service enumeration
nmap -sV -sC discovered_ports target_ip # Service detection
```

### Information Gathering Deliverables:
- Complete network topology
- Active host inventory
- Service fingerprinting results
- Initial attack surface assessment

## ‚öôÔ∏è Phase 2: Vulnerability Assessment (eJPT Focus: 17% - Assessment Methodologies)

### Automated Vulnerability Scanning:
```bash
# Network vulnerability scanning
nmap --script vuln target_ip            # Nmap vulnerability scripts
nmap --script discovery target_ip       # Discovery scripts

# Web application scanning
nikto -h http://target_ip               # Web server vulnerabilities
dirb http://target_ip                   # Directory enumeration
gobuster dir -u http://target_ip -w wordlist.txt
```

### Manual Vulnerability Assessment:
```bash
# Service-specific testing
# SSH enumeration
ssh-audit target_ip

# SMB enumeration
enum4linux target_ip
smbclient -L //target_ip

# Database enumeration
nmap --script mysql-info -p 3306 target_ip
nmap --script ms-sql-info -p 1433 target_ip

# Web application manual testing
curl -I http://target_ip                # HTTP headers analysis
whatweb http://target_ip               # Technology identification
```

### Vulnerability Assessment Deliverables:
- Prioritized vulnerability list
- Risk assessment matrix
- Proof-of-concept preparations
- Exploitation strategy planning

## üß™ Phase 3: Exploitation (eJPT Focus: 60% - Network + Web Application Testing)

### Network Service Exploitation:
```bash
# Metasploit framework usage
msfconsole
search service_name
use exploit/path/to/exploit
set RHOSTS target_ip
set payload payload_name
exploit

# Manual exploitation techniques
# FTP exploitation
ftp target_ip                          # Anonymous access testing
# SSH brute force
hydra -L users.txt -P passwords.txt ssh://target_ip
# SMB exploitation
smbclient //target_ip/share$ -U guest
```

### Web Application Exploitation:
```bash
# SQL injection testing
sqlmap -u "http://target_ip/page.php?id=1" --dbs
sqlmap -u "http://target_ip/page.php?id=1" -D database --tables
sqlmap -u "http://target_ip/page.php?id=1" -D database -T table --dump

# File upload vulnerabilities
# Upload web shells to compromised applications
# Directory traversal attacks
# Cross-site scripting (XSS) exploitation

# Command injection
# Test for OS command injection in web forms
# Exploit file inclusion vulnerabilities
```

### Exploitation Success Criteria:
- Remote code execution achieved
- Database access obtained
- Web application compromise
- Initial foothold establishment

## üéØ Phase 4: Post-Exploitation (eJPT Focus: Privilege Escalation)

### Privilege Escalation:
```bash
# Linux privilege escalation
find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null   # SUID binaries
crontab -l                             # Cron jobs
sudo -l                                # Sudo permissions

# Windows privilege escalation
whoami /priv                           # User privileges
systeminfo                            # System information
net user                              # User accounts
```

### Persistence and Lateral Movement:
```bash
# Maintain access
# Create backdoor accounts
# Install persistent shells
# Schedule persistence mechanisms

# Lateral movement
# Identify additional targets
# Credential harvesting
# Network pivoting techniques
```

### Post-Exploitation Deliverables:
- Elevated access confirmation
- Additional system compromise
- Data access demonstration
- Network foothold establishment

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common eJPT Methodology Pitfalls

### Issue 1: Inadequate Information Gathering
**Problem:** Rushing to exploitation without thorough reconnaissance
**Impact:** Missing critical attack vectors and failing exam objectives
**Solution:**
```bash
# Comprehensive discovery approach
# 1. Complete network mapping
nmap -sn network_range
# 2. Full port scanning
nmap -p 1-65535 discovered_hosts
# 3. Service enumeration
nmap -sV -sC discovered_services
# 4. Web content discovery
gobuster dir -u http://target -w wordlist -x php,html,txt
```

### Issue 2: Tool Over-Reliance
**Problem:** Depending solely on automated tools without manual verification
**Solution:**
```bash
# Manual verification approach
# After automated scanning, manually verify findings
curl -I http://target_ip               # Manual HTTP analysis
nc target_ip port                      # Manual service interaction
telnet target_ip port                  # Banner grabbing
```

### Issue 3: Poor Time Management
**Problem:** Spending too much time on single attack vectors
**Solution:**
```bash
# Time-boxed approach
# Set maximum time limits per phase
# Information Gathering: 6 hours maximum
# Each exploitation attempt: 2 hours maximum
# Move to next target if stuck
```

### Issue 4: Inadequate Documentation
**Problem:** Poor documentation leading to incomplete reports
**Solution:**
```bash
# Continuous documentation approach
# Document commands as executed
script -a exam_log.txt             # Log all terminal activity
# Screenshot all successful exploits
# Save all tool outputs
nmap target_ip > nmap_scan.txt
```
