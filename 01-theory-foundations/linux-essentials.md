## üì¶ Essential Linux Concepts

### Linux File System Hierarchy:
```bash
/               # Root directory
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ bin/        # Essential binary commands
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ etc/        # Configuration files
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ home/       # User home directories
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tmp/        # Temporary files
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ var/        # Variable data (logs)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ usr/        # User programs
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ opt/        # Optional software
```

### Command Structure:
```bash
# Basic syntax
command [options] [arguments]

# Example
ls -la /home/user
```

## üîß File System Navigation and Management

### Navigation Commands:
```bash
# Print working directory
pwd

# List directory contents
ls                    # Basic listing
ls -l                 # Long format
ls -la                # Include hidden files
ls -lh                # Human readable sizes

# Change directory
cd /path/to/directory # Absolute path
cd ../                # Parent directory
cd ~                  # Home directory
cd -                  # Previous directory
```

### File Operations:
| Command | Purpose | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `cp` | Copy files/directories | `cp file1 file2` |
| `mv` | Move/rename files | `mv oldname newname` |
| `rm` | Remove files | `rm filename` |
| `mkdir` | Create directory | `mkdir dirname` |
| `rmdir` | Remove empty directory | `rmdir dirname` |
| `touch` | Create empty file | `touch filename` |
| `find` | Search for files | `find /path -name "*.txt"` |
| `locate` | Quick file search | `locate filename` |

### File Content Management:
```bash
# View file contents
cat filename          # Display entire file
less filename         # Page through file
head filename         # First 10 lines
tail filename         # Last 10 lines
tail -f filename      # Follow file changes

# Text processing
grep "pattern" file   # Search for pattern
grep -r "text" /path  # Recursive search
sort filename         # Sort file contents
uniq filename         # Remove duplicates
wc filename          # Word count
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Process and System Management

### Process Commands:
| Command | Purpose | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `ps` | List running processes | `ps aux` |
| `top` | Real-time processes | `top` |
| `htop` | Enhanced process viewer | `htop` |
| `kill` | Terminate process | `kill PID` |
| `killall` | Kill by name | `killall firefox` |
| `jobs` | List active jobs | `jobs` |
| `nohup` | Run command immune to hangups | `nohup command &` |

### System Information:
```bash
# System details
uname -a              # System information
whoami               # Current user
id                   # User and group IDs
uptime               # System uptime
df -h                # Disk usage
free -h              # Memory usage
lscpu                # CPU information

# Network information
ifconfig             # Network interfaces (deprecated)
ip addr show         # Network interfaces (modern)
netstat -tuln        # Network connections
ss -tuln             # Socket statistics (modern)
```

## üîí Permissions and Ownership

### Understanding Permissions:
```bash
# Permission format: rwxrwxrwx (owner group other)
# r = read (4), w = write (2), x = execute (1)

# View permissions
ls -l filename

# Example output:
-rwxr-xr--  1 user group 1024 Jan 15 10:30 filename
# ^ file type
#  ^^^ owner permissions (rwx = 7)
#     ^^^ group permissions (r-x = 5)  
#        ^^^ other permissions (r-- = 4)
```

### Permission Commands:
```bash
# Change permissions
chmod 755 filename    # Numeric method
chmod u+x filename    # Symbolic method
chmod -R 644 /path    # Recursive

# Change ownership
chown user:group file # Change owner and group
chown user file       # Change owner only
chgrp group file      # Change group only

# Special permissions
chmod +t directory    # Sticky bit
chmod u+s file        # SUID bit
chmod g+s file        # SGID bit
```

## üß™ Real Lab Examples

```bash
# Navigate and explore system
pwd
# Output: /home/pentester

cd /etc
ls -la | head -10
# Output: Configuration files listing

find /etc -name "*.conf" | head -5
# Output: 
# /etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf
# /etc/kernel-img.conf
# /etc/adduser.conf
# /etc/debconf.conf
# /etc/deluser.conf

grep -r "127.0.0.1" /etc/hosts
# Output: 127.0.0.1	localhost
```

### Example 2: Process Management in Penetration Testing
```bash
# Start background process
nmap -sS 192.168.1.0/24 > scan_results.txt &
# Output: [1] 1234

# Check running processes
ps aux | grep nmap
# Output: pentester 1234  0.1  0.2  12345  2345 pts/0 R+ 10:30 0:01 nmap -sS 192.168.1.0/24

# Monitor system resources
top -p 1234
# Output: Real-time process information

# Check scan results
tail -f scan_results.txt
# Output: Live scan progress
```

### Example 3: File Analysis and Data Processing
```bash
# Analyze web server logs
tail -100 /var/log/apache2/access.log | grep "404"
# Output: 404 error entries from last 100 lines

# Extract unique IP addresses
awk '{print $1}' /var/log/apache2/access.log | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -10
# Output: Top 10 IP addresses by request count

# Search for suspicious patterns
grep -i "sql\|union\|select" /var/log/apache2/access.log
# Output: Potential SQL injection attempts
```

### Example 4: Network Configuration and Troubleshooting
```bash
# Check network interfaces
ip addr show
# Output: Network interface details with IP addresses

# View routing table
ip route show
# Output: 
# default via 192.168.1.1 dev eth0 proto dhcp metric 100
# 192.168.1.0/24 dev eth0 proto kernel scope link src 192.168.1.100

# Check listening ports
ss -tuln | grep :80
# Output: tcp LISTEN 0 128 *:80 *:*

# Test connectivity
ping -c 3 8.8.8.8
# Output: 3 ping packets to Google DNS with response times
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Issues & Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: Permission Denied Errors
**Problem:** Cannot access files or execute commands due to insufficient permissions
**Cause:** Lack of appropriate read, write, or execute permissions
**Solution:**
```bash
# Check current permissions
ls -l filename

# Fix permissions if you own the file
chmod +r filename      # Add read permission
chmod +x filename      # Add execute permission

# Use sudo for administrative tasks (if available)
sudo cat /etc/shadow   # Read privileged files
```

### Issue 2: Command Not Found
**Problem:** System cannot find the specified command
**Solution:**
```bash
# Check if command exists
which command_name     # Show command location
type command_name      # Show command type

# Update PATH if needed
echo $PATH            # Show current PATH
export PATH=$PATH:/new/path  # Add new path

# Install missing package (if possible)
apt search package_name
sudo apt install package_name
```

### Issue 3: File System Navigation Confusion
**Problem:** Getting lost in the file system hierarchy
**Prevention:**
```bash
# Always know where you are
pwd                   # Print working directory

# Use absolute paths for certainty
ls /etc/apache2/      # Absolute path
ls -la $(pwd)         # List current directory explicitly

# Bookmark important locations
alias logs='cd /var/log'
alias config='cd /etc'
```

### Issue 4: Process Management Problems
**Problem:** Processes not responding or consuming too many resources
**Solution:**
```bash
# Identify problematic processes
top                   # Interactive process monitor
ps aux --sort=-%cpu   # Sort by CPU usage

# Graceful termination
kill PID              # Send TERM signal
kill -15 PID          # Explicit TERM signal

# Force termination if needed
kill -9 PID           # Send KILL signal
killall process_name  # Kill all instances
```

## üîó Integration with Other Tools

### Primary Integration: Linux Commands + Penetration Testing Tools
```bash
# File system exploration before exploitation
find /var/www -name "*.php" -exec grep -l "mysql_connect" {} \;
# Find PHP files with database connections

# Process management for tool execution
nmap -sS target_ip > results.txt 2>&1 &  # Background scan
jobs                                      # Check job status
fg %1                                     # Bring job to foreground

# Log analysis after exploitation
tail -f /var/log/auth.log | grep ssh     # Monitor SSH attempts
grep "Failed password" /var/log/auth.log | awk '{print $11}' | sort | uniq -c
```

### Integration with Network Tools:
```bash
# Combine network discovery with file operations
nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24 | grep "Nmap scan report" | awk '{print $5}' > live_hosts.txt
for host in $(cat live_hosts.txt); do nmap -sV $host; done
```

### Integration with Web Testing:
```bash
# Analyze web server configurations
find /etc -name "*apache*" -o -name "*nginx*" | xargs ls -la
grep -r "DocumentRoot" /etc/apache2/
grep -r "server_name" /etc/nginx/
```
