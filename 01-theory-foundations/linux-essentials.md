## üéØ What Are Linux Essentials?

Linux is the main operating system used in penetration testing. Almost all hacking tools run on Linux, and you'll use Linux commands during every phase of a penetration test. This guide teaches you the exact Linux skills you need for the eJPT exam and real-world pentesting.

### üîç **Why Linux Commands Matter:**
- **95% of pentest tools** run on Linux (Kali, Parrot OS)
- **Essential for exam success** - you'll use Linux in almost every question
- **Required for real work** - log analysis, system exploration, exploit deployment
- **Foundation skill** - everything else builds on this knowledge

### üí° **What You'll Learn:**
- Navigate file systems quickly and confidently
- Search for files and information efficiently
- Analyze log files and configuration files
- Manage processes and system resources
- Use network commands for reconnaissance
- Chain commands together for powerful results

---

## üì¶ What You Need to Start

### **Already Have Everything On:**
- ‚úÖ Kali Linux (main pentesting OS)
- ‚úÖ Parrot Security OS
- ‚úÖ Any Linux system
- ‚úÖ Windows WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)

### **Check Your System:**
```bash
# See what system you're using
uname -a
# Output: Linux kali 5.10.0-kali9-amd64 #1 SMP Debian x86_64 GNU/Linux

# Check your shell
echo $SHELL
# Output: /bin/bash

# See your username
whoami
# Output: kali
```

### **What Everything Means:**
- **Terminal:** The black window where you type commands
- **Shell:** The program that runs your commands (usually bash)
- **Command:** Instructions you type to make the computer do something
- **Directory:** Same as a folder in Windows

## üèóÔ∏è Understanding the Linux File System

### **File System Structure:**
```
/                           # Root - the very top of everything
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ bin/                    # Basic commands everyone can use (ls, cat, cp)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ boot/                   # Files needed to start the computer
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dev/                    # Hardware devices (hard drives, USB)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ etc/                    # System configuration files - IMPORTANT FOR PENTESTING
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ passwd              # List of all users
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ shadow              # Encrypted passwords (need root to read)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hosts               # Computer names and IP addresses
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ssh/                # SSH server configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ home/                   # User home folders
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ kali/               # Your home folder
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ root/                   # Root user's home folder
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tmp/                    # Temporary files (deleted on reboot)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ usr/                    # Programs and applications
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ share/              # Shared data (like wordlists)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ var/                    # Files that change often - IMPORTANT FOR PENTESTING
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ log/                # System and application logs
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ www/                # Web server files
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ opt/                    # Optional software installations
```

### **Important Directories for Pentesting:**

| Directory | What's Inside | Why It Matters |
|-----------|---------------|----------------|
| `/etc/` | Configuration files | Find passwords, service settings, user accounts |
| `/var/log/` | System logs | See what happened, find evidence, analyze activity |
| `/tmp/` | Temporary files | Upload and run exploits (usually writable) |
| `/home/` | User files | Find user data, SSH keys, bash history |
| `/root/` | Root's files | High-value target for privilege escalation |

### **Path Types Explained:**

```bash
# Absolute path - starts from root (/)
/home/kali/Documents/report.txt
# Always works, no matter where you are

# Relative path - starts from where you are now
Documents/report.txt
# Only works if you're in /home/kali/

# Special paths
.           # Current directory (where you are now)
..          # Parent directory (one level up)
~           # Your home directory (/home/kali)
-           # Previous directory (where you just were)
```

---

## üìÅ Moving Around and Managing Files

### **Basic Navigation:**

#### **Where Am I? Where Can I Go?**
```bash
# Show current location
pwd
# Output: /home/kali

# List files in current directory
ls
# Output: Desktop  Documents  Downloads

# List with details
ls -l
# Output: drwxr-xr-x 2 kali kali 4096 Sep 29 10:30 Desktop

# Show hidden files (start with .)
ls -a
# Output: .  ..  .bash_history  .ssh  Desktop

# Best option - detailed with hidden files and readable sizes
ls -lah
# Output: drwxr-xr-x  2 kali kali 4.0K Sep 29 10:30 Desktop
```

#### **Moving Between Directories:**
```bash
# Go to specific directory
cd /etc
# Now you're in: /etc

# Go to your home directory
cd ~
# Now you're in: /home/kali

# Go up one level
cd ..
# If you were in /home/kali, now you're in /home

# Go back to previous directory
cd -
# Returns to wherever you just were

# Quick navigation examples
cd /var/log              # Go to log directory
cd ~/Desktop             # Go to Desktop in your home
cd ../../etc             # Go up two levels then into etc
```

### **Working With Files:**

#### **Creating and Viewing Files:**
```bash
# Create empty file
touch newfile.txt
# Creates: newfile.txt with 0 bytes

# Create directory
mkdir myfolder
# Creates: myfolder directory

# Create nested directories at once
mkdir -p hack/tools/scripts
# Creates: hack, then tools inside it, then scripts inside that

# View entire file
cat filename.txt
# Shows everything at once

# View file page by page (better for big files)
less filename.txt
# Press Space for next page, q to quit

# View first 10 lines
head filename.txt
# Shows: first 10 lines

# View last 10 lines
tail filename.txt
# Shows: last 10 lines

# Watch file changes in real-time (great for logs)
tail -f /var/log/auth.log
# Updates automatically when new lines added
```

#### **Copying, Moving, Deleting:**
```bash
# Copy file
cp source.txt destination.txt
# Result: destination.txt is copy of source.txt

# Copy directory (need -r for recursive)
cp -r folder1 folder2
# Result: folder2 is copy of folder1 with all contents

# Move or rename file
mv oldname.txt newname.txt
# Result: file renamed to newname.txt

mv file.txt /tmp/
# Result: file moved to /tmp/ directory

# Delete file
rm file.txt
# Result: file.txt is deleted (careful - no trash bin!)

# Delete directory and everything in it
rm -rf folder
# Result: folder and all contents deleted
# WARNING: This is permanent! Double-check before using!
```

### **Finding Files:**

#### **Find Command - Your Best Friend:**
```bash
# Find by name
find /etc -name "passwd"
# Searches: /etc directory for file named "passwd"
# Output: /etc/passwd

# Find by pattern (use wildcards)
find /var/log -name "*.log"
# Searches: all files ending in .log
# Output: Lists all log files

# Find only files (not directories)
find /home -type f -name "*.txt"
# Result: Only text files, not folders

# Find only directories
find /etc -type d -name "ssh*"
# Result: Only directories with names starting with ssh

# Find large files (over 100MB)
find /var -size +100M
# Result: Files bigger than 100 megabytes

# Find recently modified files (last 7 days)
find /home -mtime -7
# Result: Files changed in past week

# Find files with specific permissions
find /usr/bin -perm 4755
# Result: Files with SUID bit set (important for privilege escalation)

# Hide error messages (clean output)
find / -name "config.xml" 2>/dev/null
# Result: Only shows results, hides "Permission denied" errors
```

#### **Other Search Tools:**
```bash
# Locate - fast database search
locate passwd
# Output: All files with "passwd" in name (very fast)

# Which - find command location
which nmap
# Output: /usr/bin/nmap

# Whereis - find binaries and manuals
whereis nmap
# Output: nmap: /usr/bin/nmap /usr/share/man/man1/nmap.1.gz
```

## üìù Searching and Processing Text

### **Grep - Search Inside Files:**

#### **Basic Grep Operations:**
```bash
# Search for word in file
grep "password" file.txt
# Shows: All lines containing "password"

# Case-insensitive search (ignore UPPER/lower case)
grep -i "password" file.txt
# Finds: password, Password, PASSWORD, etc.

# Show line numbers
grep -n "error" logfile.txt
# Output: 45: ERROR: Connection failed
#         78: ERROR: Timeout occurred

# Search all files in directory
grep -r "admin" /etc/
# Searches: Every file under /etc/ for "admin"

# Invert match (show lines that DON'T match)
grep -v "success" results.txt
# Shows: Only lines without "success"

# Count matches
grep -c "failed" auth.log
# Output: 23 (number of times "failed" appears)
```

#### **Practical Grep Examples:**
```bash
# Find IP addresses in file
grep -E "[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}" access.log
# Shows: All IP address patterns like 192.168.1.100

# Find lines starting with specific text
grep "^root" /etc/passwd
# Shows: Lines that begin with "root"

# Find lines ending with specific text
grep "sh$" /etc/passwd
# Shows: Lines ending with "sh" (shell users)

# Combine with other commands
cat /etc/passwd | grep "/bin/bash"
# Shows: Only users with bash shell
```

### **AWK - Column Processing:**

```bash
# Print first column
awk '{print $1}' file.txt
# Shows: First word from each line

# Print multiple columns
awk '{print $1, $3}' file.txt
# Shows: First and third words from each line

# Use different separator (default is space)
awk -F: '{print $1}' /etc/passwd
# Uses: colon as separator
# Shows: Just usernames from /etc/passwd

# Filter and print
awk '/root/ {print $0}' /etc/passwd
# Shows: Only lines containing "root"

# Sum numbers in column
awk '{sum+=$1} END {print sum}' numbers.txt
# Result: Total of all numbers in first column

# Print lines longer than 80 characters
awk 'length($0) > 80' file.txt
# Shows: Only long lines
```

### **Sed - Text Editing:**

```bash
# Replace text (first occurrence per line)
sed 's/old/new/' file.txt
# Changes: First "old" to "new" on each line

# Replace all occurrences
sed 's/old/new/g' file.txt
# Changes: Every "old" to "new"

# Edit file in place (save changes)
sed -i 's/old/new/g' file.txt
# Result: File permanently changed

# Delete lines matching pattern
sed '/error/d' logfile.txt
# Shows: File without lines containing "error"

# Print specific line
sed -n '10p' file.txt
# Shows: Only line 10
```

### **Sort and Unique:**

```bash
# Sort alphabetically
sort file.txt
# Output: Lines in A-Z order

# Sort numerically
sort -n numbers.txt
# Output: Lines in 1-9 order (not alphabetically)

# Sort in reverse
sort -r file.txt
# Output: Lines in Z-A order

# Remove duplicate lines (only works on sorted data)
sort file.txt | uniq
# Result: Each unique line appears once

# Count duplicates
sort file.txt | uniq -c
# Output: Number before each line shows how many times it appeared

# Most common items (sorted by frequency)
sort file.txt | uniq -c | sort -nr
# Result: Most frequent items at top
```

### **Cut - Extract Columns:**

```bash
# Extract first field (colon separator)
cut -d: -f1 /etc/passwd
# Shows: Just usernames

# Extract multiple fields
cut -d: -f1,3 /etc/passwd
# Shows: Username and user ID

# Extract by character position
cut -c1-10 file.txt
# Shows: First 10 characters of each line
```

# Show your processes
ps
# Output: Processes in your current terminal

# Show all processes (detailed)
ps aux
# Output: Every running process with full details
# Columns: USER PID %CPU %MEM VSZ RSS TTY STAT START TIME COMMAND

# Understand ps aux output:
# USER = who started it
# PID = process ID number
# %CPU = how much CPU it's using
# %MEM = how much memory it's using
# COMMAND = what program is running

# Sort by CPU usage
ps aux --sort=-%cpu
# Shows: Most CPU-intensive processes first

# Sort by memory usage
ps aux --sort=-%mem
# Shows: Most memory-hungry processes first

# Find specific process
ps aux | grep apache
# Shows: Only processes with "apache" in name

# Show process tree
pstree
# Output: Processes shown as parent-child relationships

# Real-time process monitor
top
# Updates every few seconds
# Press q to quit, h for help
```

### **Controlling Processes:**

```bash
# Run command in background
command &
# Example: nmap 192.168.1.0/24 &
# Result: Command runs, you get prompt back immediately

# Run command immune to logout
nohup command &
# Result: Process keeps running even if you disconnect

# See background jobs
jobs
# Output: [1]+ Running    nmap 192.168.1.0/24 &

# Bring job to foreground
fg
# Result: Last background job comes back to terminal

# Send job to background
bg
# Result: Paused job continues in background

# Stop process (graceful shutdown)
kill PID
# Example: kill 1234
# Result: Process 1234 receives termination signal

# Force kill process (immediate)
kill -9 PID
# Example: kill -9 1234
# Result: Process 1234 stopped immediately (no cleanup)

# Kill all processes by name

## üîí File Permissions and Security

### **Understanding Permissions:**

```
-rwxr-xr-x  1 kali kali 4096 Sep 29 10:30 script.sh
‚îÇ‚îÇ‚îÇ‚îÇ‚îÇ‚îÇ‚îÇ‚îÇ‚îÇ  ‚îÇ  ‚îÇ    ‚îÇ    ‚îÇ    ‚îÇ
‚îÇ‚îÇ‚îÇ‚îî‚î¥‚î¥‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îº‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îº‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îº‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îº‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¥‚îÄ Other: read + execute
‚îÇ‚îÇ‚îî‚î¥‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îº‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îº‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îº‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¥‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ Group: read + execute  
‚îÇ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îº‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îº‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¥‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ Owner: read + write + execute
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îº‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¥‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ File type: - = file, d = directory
           ‚îÇ
           ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ Number of links

Permission meanings:
r = read (4)    - can view file contents
w = write (2)   - can modify file
x = execute (1) - can run as program
- = no permission (0)
```

### **Common Permission Numbers:**

| Number | Permissions | Meaning | Use Case |
|--------|-------------|---------|----------|
| `755` | `rwxr-xr-x` | Owner can do everything, others can read/execute | Scripts, programs |
| `644` | `rw-r--r--` | Owner can read/write, others can only read | Text files, configs |
| `600` | `rw-------` | Only owner can read/write | Private files, SSH keys |
| `777` | `rwxrwxrwx` | Everyone can do everything | Rarely used (insecure) |
| `700` | `rwx------` | Only owner can do anything | Private directories |

### **Changing Permissions:**

```bash
# View permissions
ls -l filename
# Output: -rw-r--r-- 1 kali kali 1234 Sep 29 10:30 filename

# Change with numbers
chmod 755 script.sh
# Result: rwxr-xr-x (owner full, others read/execute)

# Change with letters
chmod u+x script.sh
# Result: Add execute for user (owner)

chmod g-w filename
# Result: Remove write for group

chmod o+r filename
# Result: Add read for others

# Change recursively (all files in directory)
chmod -R 644 myfolder/
# Result: All files in myfolder set to rw-r--r--

# Change owner
chown newuser filename
# Result: newuser now owns file

# Change owner and group
chown newuser:newgroup filename
# Result: newuser owns, newgroup is group

# Change group only
chgrp newgroup filename
# Result: Group changed to newgroup
```

### **Special Permissions (Important for Pentesting):**

```bash
# Find SUID files (run as owner, not current user)
find / -perm -4000 2>/dev/null
# Why important: Potential privilege escalation
# Example output: /usr/bin/passwd (runs as root)

# Find SGID files (run with group privileges)
find / -perm -2000 2>/dev/null
# Why important: Another escalation vector

# Find world-writable files (anyone can modify)
find / -perm -002 2>/dev/null
# Why important: May allow unauthorized modifications

# Set SUID bit
chmod 4755 filename
# Result: File runs with owner's privileges

# Set SGID bit
chmod 2755 filename
# Result: File runs with group's privileges

# Set sticky bit
chmod 1755 directory
# Result: Only owner can delete files in directory
```

### **User and Group Files:**

```bash
# User accounts
cat /etc/passwd
# Format: username:x:UID:GID:comment:home:shell
# Example: kali:x:1000:1000:Kali,,,:/home/kali:/bin/bash

# Encrypted passwords (requires root)
sudo cat /etc/shadow
# Format: username:encrypted_password:last_change:...
# Example: kali:$6$xyz...:18920:0:99999:7:::

# Group information
cat /etc/group
# Format: groupname:x:GID:members
# Example: sudo:x:27:kali

# Your groups
groups
# Output: kali sudo
```

---

## üåê Network Commands

### **Network Interface Info:**

```bash
# Show all network interfaces (modern way)
ip addr show
# Output: Shows all network cards with IP addresses
# Example:
# 2: eth0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP>
#     inet 192.168.1.100/24 brd 192.168.1.255 scope global eth0

# Show routing table
ip route show
# Output: default via 192.168.1.1 dev eth0
#         192.168.1.0/24 dev eth0 scope link

# Show ARP table (IP to MAC mappings)
ip neighbor show
# Output: 192.168.1.1 dev eth0 lladdr 00:11:22:33:44:55 REACHABLE

# Old way (still works on many systems)
ifconfig
# Output: Similar to ip addr but older format

# Old routing table command
route -n
# Output: Routing table in old format

# Old ARP command
arp -a
# Output: ARP cache in old format
```

### **Testing Connectivity:**

```bash
# Test if host is reachable
ping -c 4 google.com
# -c 4 = send 4 packets then stop
# Output: Shows if packets reach destination and response time

# Trace route to destination
traceroute google.com
# Output: Shows each router hop along the way
# Example:
# 1  192.168.1.1 (192.168.1.1)  1.234 ms
# 2  10.0.0.1 (10.0.0.1)  10.456 ms
# 3  google.com (172.217.1.1)  15.789 ms

# DNS lookup
nslookup google.com
# Output: Shows IP address for domain name

# Detailed DNS info
dig google.com
# Output: Complete DNS query results with all records

# Simple DNS lookup
host google.com
# Output: google.com has address 172.217.1.1

# Test port connectivity with netcat
nc -zv target.com 80
# -z = scan mode (don't send data)
# -v = verbose
# Output: Connection to target.com 80 port [tcp/http] succeeded!

# Test with telnet
telnet target.com 80
# Result: Connects to port 80 if open
# Type: GET / HTTP/1.0 and press Enter twice to test web server
```

### **Active Connections:**

```bash
# Show listening ports (modern way)
ss -tuln
# -t = TCP
# -u = UDP  
# -l = listening
# -n = numeric (don't resolve names)
# Output: Shows all services waiting for connections

# Include process info (requires root)
sudo ss -tulnp
# -p = process
# Output: Shows which program is using each port

# Old way (still common)
netstat -tuln
# Output: Same info as ss but older command

# Show all connections (not just listening)
ss -tun
# Output: All active TCP/UDP connections

# Show what's using specific port
lsof -i :22
# Output: What process is using port 22
# Example: sshd 1234 root 3u IPv4 TCP *:ssh (LISTEN)

# Show all network connections for process
lsof -i -n -P
# -i = internet connections
# -n = don't resolve IPs
# -P = don't resolve ports
```

## üöÄ Advanced Techniques

### **Command Chaining:**

```bash
# Run second command only if first succeeds
mkdir newfolder && cd newfolder
# Result: Creates folder AND enters it (both must work)

# Run second command only if first fails
ls file.txt || touch file.txt
# Result: If file doesn't exist, create it

# Run both regardless
command1 ; command2
# Result: Runs command1, then command2 no matter what

# Practical examples
ping -c 1 target > /dev/null && echo "Host is up" || echo "Host is down"
# Result: Shows if host responds to ping

find /etc -name "*.conf" 2>/dev/null | wc -l
# Result: Count config files (hiding errors)
```

### **Input/Output Redirection:**

```bash
# Save output to file (overwrite)
command > output.txt
# Example: ls -la > filelist.txt

# Append to file
command >> output.txt
# Example: echo "New line" >> log.txt

# Redirect errors only
command 2> errors.log
# Result: Errors saved to errors.log, normal output shown

# Redirect both output and errors
command > output.txt 2>&1
# Result: Everything saved to output.txt

# Hide errors
command 2>/dev/null
# Result: Error messages disappear

# Pipe output to next command
command1 | command2
# Example: cat file.txt | grep "error"
# Result: Search file contents

# Save to file AND continue pipe
command1 | tee file.txt | command2
# Result: Saves output to file.txt and sends to command2
```

### **Practical Command Combinations:**

```bash
# Find top 10 IP addresses in log
cat access.log | awk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -10
# Breaks down to:
# 1. Show log file
# 2. Extract first column (IP addresses)
# 3. Sort them
# 4. Count duplicates
# 5. Sort by count (highest first)
# 6. Show top 10

# Find largest files in directory
find /var/log -type f -exec du -h {} \; | sort -hr | head -20
# Result: 20 biggest files with sizes

# Find top CPU processes
ps aux | sort -nrk 3 | head -5
# Result: 5 processes using most CPU

# Find top memory processes  
ps aux | sort -nrk 4 | head -5
# Result: 5 processes using most memory

# Count files by type
find . -type f | sed 's/.*\.//' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr
# Result: How many .txt, .jpg, etc files

# Find recently modified files
find /home -type f -mtime -1 -ls
# Result: Files changed in last 24 hours with details
```

### **File Compression:**

```bash
# Create tar archive
tar -cvf archive.tar folder/
# -c = create
# -v = verbose (show progress)
# -f = file name
# Result: archive.tar contains everything in folder/

# Create compressed archive
tar -czvf archive.tar.gz folder/
# -z = gzip compression
# Result: Smaller file size

# Extract tar archive
tar -xvf archive.tar
# -x = extract
# Result: Files extracted to current directory

# Extract to specific location
tar -xvf archive.tar -C /tmp/
# Result: Extracted to /tmp/

# List archive contents without extracting
tar -tvf archive.tar
# -t = list
# Result: Shows what's inside

# Create zip file
zip -r archive.zip folder/
# -r = recursive
# Result: archive.zip created

# Extract zip file
unzip archive.zip
# Result: Files extracted

# Compress single file
gzip file.txt
# Result: file.txt becomes file.txt.gz (original deleted)

# Decompress
gunzip file.txt.gz
# Result: Back to file.txt
```

# Output: apache2  1234  www-data  4u  IPv4  TCP *:8080 (LISTEN)

# Method 3: Process list
ps aux | grep 1234
# Output: www-data  1234  apache2 -k start

# Answer: Apache web server (PID 1234)
```

---

#### **Scenario 4: Log Analysis for Failed Logins**
**Question:** "Which IP address had the most failed login attempts?"
**Time:** 3-4 minutes

```bash
# Step 1: Check auth log exists
ls -la /var/log/auth.log

# Step 2: Find failed attempts
grep "Failed password" /var/log/auth.log

# Step 3: Extract IPs and count
grep "Failed password" /var/log/auth.log | \
    awk '{print $(NF-3)}' | \
    sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -1
# Output: 45 192.168.1.50

# Alternative method
grep "Failed password" /var/log/auth.log | \
    grep -oE "[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}" | \

# Common output:
# /usr/bin/passwd
# /usr/bin/sudo
# /usr/bin/pkexec
# /usr/lib/openssh/ssh-keysign

# Find unusual SUID files (exclude common ones)
find / -perm -4000 -type f 2>/dev/null | \
    grep -v -E "(passwd|sudo|su|pkexec|ssh-keysign)"

# Check if specific binary has SUID
ls -la /usr/bin/find
# If output starts with -rwsr-x--- then it has SUID
```

---

### **üìù eJPT Exam Tips:**

#### **‚è∞ Time Management Strategy:**
1. **Read question carefully** (15 seconds)
2. **Choose right command** (15 seconds)
3. **Execute and verify** (1-2 minutes)
4. **Document answer** (30 seconds)
5. **Move to next question** (no dwelling)

**Total per question: 2-3 minutes maximum**

#### **üéØ Exam Day Checklist:**

```bash
# Before starting, verify these work:
find / -name test 2>/dev/null       # File finding works
grep "test" /etc/passwd              # Grep works
ps aux | head                        # Process listing works
ss -tuln | head                      # Network commands work
ls -la /etc | head                   # Permissions visible

# If any fail, troubleshoot before starting exam
```

#### **Common Mistakes to Avoid:**

**‚ùå Wrong:**
```bash
# Mistake 1: Not hiding errors
find / -name config.txt
# Result: Screen filled with "Permission denied"

# Mistake 2: Relative paths in exams
find . -name config.txt
# Problem: Only searches current directory

# Mistake 3: Forgetting to count
grep "user" /etc/passwd
# Problem: Shows lines but doesn't count them

# Mistake 4: Wrong field separator
cut -f1 /etc/passwd
# Problem: Doesn't specify colon separator
```

**‚úÖ Correct:**
```bash
# Fix 1: Hide errors
find / -name config.txt 2>/dev/null

# Fix 2: Use absolute paths
find /etc -name config.txt 2>/dev/null

# Fix 3: Count results
grep "user" /etc/passwd | wc -l

# Fix 4: Specify separator
cut -d: -f1 /etc/passwd
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Problems and Solutions

### **‚ùå Problem 1: Permission Denied Errors**
**What You See:**
```bash
find / -name "*.conf"
find: '/root': Permission denied
find: '/var/lib/private': Permission denied
# ... hundreds of error lines
```

**How to Fix:**
```bash
# Solution 1: Hide error messages
find / -name "*.conf" 2>/dev/null
# Result: Only shows files you can access

# Solution 2: Use sudo if available
sudo find / -name "*.conf"
# Result: Searches everything

# Solution 3: Search only accessible areas
find /home -name "*.conf"
find /var/www -name "*.conf"
# Result: Target specific directories
```

---

### **‚ùå Problem 2: Command Not Found**
**What You See:**
```bash
ifconfig
bash: ifconfig: command not found
```

**How to Fix:**
```bash
# Solution 1: Try modern alternative
ip addr show
# Modern systems use 'ip' instead of 'ifconfig'

# Solution 2: Find where command is
which ifconfig
whereis ifconfig
# May show: /usr/sbin/ifconfig

# Solution 3: Use full path
/usr/sbin/ifconfig
# Some commands need full path

# Solution 4: Check if installed
dpkg -l | grep net-tools
# ifconfig is in net-tools package
```

**Common Command Alternatives:**
| Old Command | New Alternative |
|-------------|-----------------|
| `ifconfig` | `ip addr show` |
| `route -n` | `ip route show` |
| `arp -a` | `ip neighbor show` |
| `netstat` | `ss` |

---

### **‚ùå Problem 3: File Not Found**
**What You See:**
```bash
cat /var/log/auth.log
cat: /var/log/auth.log: No such file or directory
```

**How to Fix:**
```bash
# Solution 1: Check if file exists
ls -la /var/log/ | grep auth
# May be named differently: auth.log, secure, authentication.log

# Solution 2: Find similar files
find /var/log -name "*auth*" -type f 2>/dev/null
# Shows all authentication-related logs

# Solution 3: Check alternative locations
cat /var/log/secure          # Red Hat/CentOS
cat /var/log/authentication  # Some systems
cat /var/log/syslog | grep ssh  # Combined log

# Solution 4: List all logs
ls -la /var/log/
# See what's actually available
```

---

### **‚ùå Problem 4: No Results from Search**
**What You See:**
```bash
grep "password" config.txt
# No output at all
```

**How to Fix:**
```bash
# Solution 1: Check if file has content
cat config.txt
# Verify file isn't empty

# Solution 2: Try case-insensitive search
grep -i "password" config.txt
# Finds: password, Password, PASSWORD, etc.

# Solution 3: Search for partial match
grep -i "pass" config.txt
# Broader search

# Solution 4: Check if pattern is too specific
grep ".*password.*" config.txt
# Use wildcards

# Solution 5: Verify file path
ls -la config.txt
# Make sure file exists and is readable
```
