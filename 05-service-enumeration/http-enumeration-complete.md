Comprehensive guide for enumerating HTTP/HTTPS services to identify web technologies, directories, files, and potential vulnerabilities.
**Location:** `05-service-enumeration/http-enumeration-complete.md`

## üéØ What is HTTP Enumeration?

HTTP enumeration is the process of gathering detailed information about web services running on target systems. This includes identifying web server software, versions, directory structures, hidden files, authentication mechanisms, and potential entry points for further exploitation.

HTTP enumeration is critical for understanding the attack surface of web applications and forms the foundation for web application penetration testing. Key capabilities include:
- Web server fingerprinting and version detection
- Directory and file discovery
- Technology stack identification
- Authentication mechanism analysis
- Configuration file discovery
- Administrative interface location

## üì¶ Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites:
- Kali Linux with Metasploit Framework
- Basic understanding of HTTP protocol
- Target web service accessibility

### Verification:
```bash
# Verify Metasploit installation
msfconsole --version
# Expected output: Framework Version information

# Check connectivity to target
ping -c 3 target_ip
# Expected output: Successful ping responses
```

### Initial Configuration:
```bash
# Start Metasploit console
msfconsole -q

# Verify auxiliary HTTP modules are available
search auxiliary/scanner/http
```

## üîß Basic Usage and Syntax

### Basic Workflow:
1. **Connectivity Test:** Verify target is reachable via HTTP/HTTPS
2. **Service Detection:** Identify web server and technologies
3. **Directory Discovery:** Find hidden directories and files
4. **Content Analysis:** Examine discovered resources
5. **Authentication Testing:** Identify login mechanisms
6. **User Enumeration:** Discover valid usernames if applicable

### Command Structure:
```bash
# Basic Metasploit HTTP enumeration workflow
use auxiliary/scanner/http/[module_name]
set RHOSTS target_ip
set [additional_options] values

### Essential Skills for eJPT:
- **HTTP Service Identification** (25% of web enumeration tasks)
- **Directory Discovery** (30% of enumeration scenarios)
- **File Upload/Download Testing** (20% of web application tests)
- **Basic Authentication Testing** (15% of access control tests)
- **Technology Stack Recognition** (10% of information gathering)

### Critical Commands to Master:
```bash
# Must-know for eJPT exam
use auxiliary/scanner/http/http_version    # Always start here for web services
use auxiliary/scanner/http/dir_scanner     # Essential for finding hidden content
use auxiliary/scanner/http/robots_txt      # Quick wins for directory discovery
use auxiliary/scanner/http/http_header     # Technology identification
use auxiliary/scanner/http/files_dir       # Sensitive file discovery
```

### eJPT Exam Scenarios:
1. **Web Service Discovery:** Identify running web services and their versions
   - Required skills: HTTP version detection, header analysis
   - Expected commands: `http_version`, `http_header`
   - Success criteria: Web server type and version identified

2. **Hidden Content Discovery:** Find administrative interfaces and sensitive files
   - Required skills: Directory enumeration, robots.txt analysis
   - Expected commands: `dir_scanner`, `robots_txt`, `files_dir`
   - Success criteria: Administrative panels or config files located

3. **File Upload Exploitation:** Test for insecure file upload capabilities
   - Required skills: HTTP PUT method testing, file manipulation
   - Expected commands: `http_put` with various payloads
   - Success criteria: Successful file upload and verification

4. **Authentication Bypass:** Identify weak authentication mechanisms
   - Required skills: Login form discovery, basic credential testing
   - Expected commands: `http_login`, credential list testing
   - Success criteria: Valid credentials discovered or bypass identified

### Exam Tips and Tricks:
- **Start with robots.txt:** Always check for directory hints before brute forcing
- **Use default wordlists:** Metasploit's built-in wordlists are sufficient for eJPT
- **Document everything:** Screenshot all discovered directories and files
- **Test file operations:** Always verify file uploads/downloads work as expected
- **Check common paths:** /admin, /manager, /phpmyadmin are frequent targets

### Common eJPT Questions:
- What web server software and version is running on the target?
- What directories are disclosed in the robots.txt file?
- Can you upload files to the web server? If so, to which directory?
- What authentication mechanism is used for protected directories?

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Issues & Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: Connection Timeouts During Enumeration
**Problem:** Modules hang or timeout when connecting to target web services
**Cause:** Network connectivity issues, firewall blocking, or service unavailability
**Solution:**
```bash
# Verify basic connectivity first
ping -c 3 target_ip

# Test HTTP connectivity manually
curl -I http://target_ip:port

# Adjust timeout settings in Metasploit
set HttpClientTimeout 30
set HttpReadTimeout 30
```

### Issue 2: SSL/TLS Certificate Errors
**Problem:** HTTPS enumeration fails due to certificate validation
**Solution:**
```bash
# Enable SSL and ignore certificate validation
set SSL true
set HttpClientVerifySSL false

# Alternative: Test with curl first
curl -k -I https://target_ip
```

### Issue 3: Rate Limiting and Detection Avoidance
**Problem:** Target implements rate limiting or intrusion detection
**Prevention:**
```bash
# Slow down scanning to avoid detection
set DELAY 2

# Use minimal verbosity to reduce noise
set VERBOSE false

# Test with smaller wordlists first
set DICTIONARY /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/short_list.txt
```

### Issue 4: Metasploit Module Loading Issues
**Problem:** HTTP scanner modules fail to load or execute
**Optimization:**
```bash
# Update Metasploit framework
msfupdate

# Reload modules if needed
reload_all

# Check module dependencies
info auxiliary/scanner/http/module_name
```

## üîó Integration with Other Tools

### Primary Integration: Nmap ‚Üí HTTP Enumeration ‚Üí Web Application Testing
```bash
# Complete workflow showing tool integration
nmap -sV -p80,443,8080 target_ip | grep "open"

# Feed discovered web ports into Metasploit
msfconsole -q
use auxiliary/scanner/http/http_version
set RHOSTS target_ip
set RPORT discovered_port
run

# Use results for targeted web application testing
```
