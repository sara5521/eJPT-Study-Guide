# 🔧 HTTP Enumeration - Complete Web Service Analysis

**Essential web service enumeration skills for eJPT exam - Master web reconnaissance to succeed!**

## 🎯 What is HTTP Enumeration?

**HTTP enumeration** is the process of gathering detailed information about web services running on target systems. This technique is **super important for eJPT exam** because it covers 25% of all enumeration tasks and leads to many exploitation opportunities.

### How HTTP Enumeration Works
```bash
# Basic workflow:
# 1. Identify web service → use auxiliary/scanner/http/http_version
# 2. Discover directories → use auxiliary/scanner/http/dir_scanner
# 3. Find files → use auxiliary/scanner/http/files_dir
# 4. Test file upload → use auxiliary/scanner/http/http_put
# 5. Check authentication → use auxiliary/scanner/http/http_login
```

### Why It's So Important
- **Web Apps Everywhere** - Most systems run web services
- **Attack Surface** - Web apps have many entry points
- **Information Disclosure** - Often reveals sensitive data
- **eJPT Focus** - 25% of exam scenarios involve web enumeration

### Time Management for eJPT

**⏰ Optimal Time Distribution for Web Enumeration:**
- **🔍 Service Detection:** 5 minutes (15%)
- **📁 Directory Discovery:** 10 minutes (30%)
- **📄 File Enumeration:** 8 minutes (25%)
- **🔐 Authentication Testing:** 7 minutes (20%)
- **📝 Documentation:** 3 minutes (10%)

### Success Tips for eJPT

**🔥 Before Starting Web Enumeration:**
- Always verify HTTP service is actually running
- Check both HTTP (80) and HTTPS (443) if available
- Set global RHOSTS to save time during exam
- Have wordlist paths memorized

**🔥 During Web Enumeration:**
- Start with robots.txt - it often gives you directory hints
- Use VERBOSE false to reduce output clutter
- Take screenshots of all discovered directories
- Test file upload immediately when found

**🔥 Common Mistakes to Avoid:**
- ❌ Skipping robots.txt check (misses easy wins)
- ❌ Using verbose output (wastes time reading)
- ❌ Not testing both HTTP and HTTPS
- ❌ Forgetting to document discovered URLs
- ❌ Not verifying file uploads actually work

## ⚠️ Common Problems and Solutions

### Problem 1: Connection Timeouts During Scanning

**🚨 What's wrong:** HTTP modules hang or timeout when scanning target

**🔍 Why this happens:**
- Target web server is slow or overloaded
- Network connectivity issues
- Firewall blocking requests
- SSL/TLS configuration problems

**✅ How to fix:**
```bash
# Test basic connectivity first
ping victim-1
curl -I http://victim-1

# Adjust timeout settings
set HttpClientTimeout 30
set HttpReadTimeout 30

# For HTTPS targets
set SSL true
set HttpClientVerifySSL false
```

### Problem 2: Module Returns No Results

**🚨 What's wrong:** Directory or file scanners find nothing

**🔍 Why this happens:**
- Web server returns custom error pages
- Default wordlists don't match target
- Wrong port or protocol specified
- Rate limiting blocking requests

**✅ How to fix:**
```bash
# Verify HTTP service manually
telnet victim-1 80
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: victim-1

# Try different wordlists
set DICTIONARY /usr/share/dirb/wordlists/common.txt
set DICTIONARY /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt

# Check different ports
set RPORT 8080
set RPORT 443
set SSL true
```

### Problem 3: File Upload Testing Fails

**🚨 What's wrong:** http_put module reports errors or doesn't work

**🔍 Why this happens:**
- HTTP PUT method disabled on server
- Insufficient permissions for target directory
- File already exists
- Web server blocks certain file types

**✅ How to fix:**
```bash
# Test manual HTTP PUT first
curl -X PUT -d "test content" http://victim-1/data/test.txt

# Try different directories
set PATH /uploads
set PATH /files
set PATH /temp

# Try different file extensions
set FILENAME test.html
set FILENAME test.txt
set FILENAME test.php
```

### Problem 4: Authentication Testing Issues

**🚨 What's wrong:** http_login module doesn't find credentials

**🔍 Why this happens:**
- Wrong authentication URI specified
- Target uses form-based instead of basic auth
- Account lockout after failed attempts
- Custom authentication mechanism

**✅ How to fix:**
```bash
# Verify authentication type manually
curl -I http://victim-1/secure/

# Check for different auth paths
set AUTH_URI /admin/
set AUTH_URI /login/
set AUTH_URI /manager/

# Use smaller wordlists to avoid lockout
set USER_FILE /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/common_users.txt
set PASS_FILE /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/common_passwords.txt
set STOP_ON_SUCCESS true
```

## 🔗 Integration with Other Tools

### Main Web Testing Workflow

```bash
# Step 1: Port Discovery (External tools)
nmap -sS -sV -p80,443,8080,8443 target_ip    # Find web ports
nmap --script http-enum target_ip             # Basic HTTP enumeration

# Step 2: Import into Metasploit
msfconsole -q
setg RHOSTS target_ip

# Step 3: Systematic HTTP Enumeration
use auxiliary/scanner/http/http_version       # Service identification
use auxiliary/scanner/http/robots_txt         # Directory hints
use auxiliary/scanner/http/dir_scanner        # Directory discovery
use auxiliary/scanner/http/files_dir          # File enumeration

# Step 4: Advanced Testing
use auxiliary/scanner/http/http_put           # Upload testing
use auxiliary/scanner/http/http_login         # Authentication
```

### Tool Chain Integration

```bash
# Nmap → Metasploit → Manual Testing workflow

# 1. Nmap discovers web services
nmap -sV -p- target_ip | grep "http"

# 2. Metasploit enumerates web content
msfconsole -q -x "
setg RHOSTS target_ip;
use auxiliary/scanner/http/http_version; run;
use auxiliary/scanner/http/dir_scanner; run;
exit"

# 3. Manual verification with curl/browser
curl http://target_ip/discovered_directory/
firefox http://target_ip/admin/
```

### Database Integration Example

```bash
# Store enumeration results in database
msfconsole -q
setg RHOSTS target_ip

# Run multiple HTTP scans
use auxiliary/scanner/http/http_version; run
use auxiliary/scanner/http/dir_scanner; run
use auxiliary/scanner/http/files_dir; run

# Query results from database
services -c port,name,info -S http
notes -t web.directory
notes -t web.file
```
